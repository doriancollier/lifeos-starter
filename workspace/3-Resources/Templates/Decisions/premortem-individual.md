# Individual Pre-Mortem: {{title}}

> [!ai-context]
> Personal decision pre-mortem using prospective hindsight. Research shows this framing increases accuracy in identifying failure reasons by 30%. Use before major decisions: career changes, financial commitments, relationship decisions, or strategic pivots.

## Decision Setup

**Decision Being Considered**:


**Decision Deadline**:

**Outcome Evaluation Date**:

**Current Confidence Level**: /10

---

## The Pre-Mortem Scenario

> It is **[date 6-12 months from now]**. You made this decision, and it has **failed spectacularly**. You deeply regret it. Your life is worse because of this choice.

### The Failure Story

Write a vivid narrative: What happened? How did it unfold?

## Failure Reasons

### Brainstorm (aim for 10-15 items)

List everything that could have caused this failure:

## Categorization: Tigers, Paper Tigers, and Elephants

### Tigers (Real threats requiring action)

These will hurt me if unaddressed:

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

### Paper Tigers (Apparent threats I'm not actually worried about)

These seem threatening but I've considered them and they're manageable:

1.
2.
3.

### Elephants (The things I'm avoiding thinking about)

> What am I not talking about? What makes me uncomfortable to consider?

## Probability and Impact Assessment

| Risk (Tigers + Elephants) | Probability | Impact | Priority |
|---------------------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| | L / M / H | L / M / H | |
| | L / M / H | L / M / H | |
| | L / M / H | L / M / H | |
| | L / M / H | L / M / H | |
| | L / M / H | L / M / H | |

### Priority Matrix

|  | Low Impact | High Impact |
|--|-----------|-------------|
| **High Probability** | Monitor | **Address First** |
| **Low Probability** | Accept | Plan Contingency |

## Decision Quality Check

### Is This Confidence or Overconfidence?

- [ ] I've genuinely considered how this could fail
- [ ] I've identified what I don't know
- [ ] I've consulted others who might see my blind spots
- [ ] I can articulate specific conditions that would change my mind

### Information Gaps

**What information would change my mind?**


**What don't I know that I should know?**


**Who should I consult?**


---

## Decision

- [ ] **Proceed as planned** - Risks are manageable
- [ ] **Proceed with modifications** - After implementing:
  -
  -
- [ ] **Delay until** - Waiting for:
- [ ] **Abandon** - Because:

## If Proceeding: Commitments

### Mitigation Actions I Commit To

### Monitoring Commitments

**I will watch for**:


**Checkpoint date to reassess**:

## Post-Mortem Connection

After the outcome evaluation date, complete:

**Predicted vs. Actual**:

| Predicted Risk | Did It Occur? | Severity | Prevention Effective? |
|----------------|---------------|----------|----------------------|
| | Yes/No | | Yes/No |
| | Yes/No | | Yes/No |
| | Yes/No | | Yes/No |

**Surprises (things I didn't predict)**:
