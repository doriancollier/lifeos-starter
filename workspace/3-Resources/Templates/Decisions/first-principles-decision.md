# First Principles Decision: {{title}}

> [!ai-context]
> This template breaks down decisions to fundamental truths rather than reasoning by analogy. Use for high-stakes decisions, when costs seem prohibitive, when current solutions fail, or when breakthrough results are needed.

## Decision Overview

**Decision Being Considered**:


**Context**: Why is this decision arising now?


**Stakes Level**: [ ] High (use full template) / [ ] Medium (abbreviated) / [ ] Low (consider simpler approach)

---

## Step 1: Identify and Question Assumptions

> What do you believe about this decision? What "common wisdom" are you following?

### Current Assumptions

List everything you believe to be true about this decision:

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

### Source Analysis

For each assumption, ask: Where did this belief come from?

| Assumption | Source | Inherited or Verified? |
|------------|--------|----------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### Challenge Questions

- Am I copying what others do, or reasoning from fundamentals?
- What would I do if I were starting completely from scratch today?
- Which of these assumptions have I personally validated?
- What would change if assumption #___ were false?

---

## Step 2: Deconstruct to Fundamental Truths

> Separate what you KNOW to be true from what you ASSUME to be true.

### Apply the Five Whys

**Statement**: [Your initial belief or constraint]

1. **Why 1**:
2. **Why 2**:
3. **Why 3**:
4. **Why 4**:
5. **Why 5**:

**Conclusion**: First principle found OR assumption exposed?

### Fundamental Truths (Bedrock Facts)

What is undeniably, verifiably true? (Physics, economics, human nature)

1.
2.
3.

### Fundamental Constraints

Which constraints are real (physics, law) vs. artificial (convention, assumption)?

| Constraint | Type | Evidence |
|------------|------|----------|
| | Real / Artificial | |
| | Real / Artificial | |

---

## Step 3: Function vs. Form Analysis

> What job is this actually doing? Is the current form the best way?

### Function Identification

**What is the fundamental outcome I want?**


**What need does this serve?**


### Form Evaluation

**Current approach (form)**:


**Alternative forms that could achieve the same function**:

1.
2.
3.

### Simplest Path Question

> If I could achieve the fundamental need a different way, would that be just as good?

---

## Step 4: Rebuild from Fundamentals

> Now design from scratch, constrained only by fundamental truths.

### If starting with a blank slate today, what would I design?


### Proposed Solution

**Description**:


**How does this differ from conventional approach?**


**Why is this better given the fundamental truths?**


---

## Step 5: Reality Test

> Before committing, test the rebuilt solution against reality.

### Validation Questions

- [ ] Does this solution address the fundamental function?
- [ ] Does it respect the real constraints identified?
- [ ] What experiment could validate this approach?
- [ ] What's the smallest test I could run?

### Experiment Design

**Hypothesis**:


**Test Method**:


**Success Criteria**:


**Timeline**:

## Step 6: Decision Documentation

### Final Decision


### Reasoning Chain

From fundamental truth to decision:

1. **Truth**:
2. **Therefore**:
3. **Therefore**:
4. **Decision**:

### What I'm NOT doing (and why)


### Implementation Next Steps

## Reflection Questions

Before finalizing, consider:

- [ ] Would I make this same decision if I had no history with this problem?
- [ ] Is this aligned with what I genuinely want, or what's expected?
- [ ] Am I being productive or just busy?
- [ ] Does this serve a fundamental goal or inherited obligation?
