# Decision Inversion: {{title}}

> [!ai-context]
> Think backwards from failure before deciding. Based on Charlie Munger's principle: "All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there." Avoiding stupidity is often more reliable than seeking brilliance.

## Decision Overview

**Decision Being Considered**:


**Context**:


**Timeline for Decision**:


---

## Part 1: Forward Thinking (Traditional Analysis)

### Expected Benefits

What do I hope to gain from this decision?

1.
2.
3.

### Success Metrics

How will I know this was a good decision?

| Metric | Target | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| | | |
| | | |

### Probability of Success (honest estimate)

- [ ] Very High (>80%)
- [ ] High (60-80%)
- [ ] Medium (40-60%)
- [ ] Low (20-40%)
- [ ] Very Low (<20%)

## Part 2: Inverted Thinking (Failure Analysis)

### The Inversion Question

> "How could this fail spectacularly? What would guarantee this doesn't work?"

### Failure Scenarios

List 5-10 ways this decision could lead to regret:

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.
10.

### What Would I Tell a Friend?

- [ ] Financially
- [ ] Reputationally
- [ ] Relationship-wise
- [ ] Health-wise
- [ ] Energetically

> If ANY box is checked, this is a potential ruin-risk decision. Proceed with extreme caution or decline.

## Part 3: Failure Mode Ranking

### Top 3 Most Likely Failure Modes

| Rank | Failure Mode | Probability | Impact | Prevention Available? |
|------|--------------|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| 1 | | H/M/L | H/M/L | Yes/No |
| 2 | | H/M/L | H/M/L | Yes/No |
| 3 | | H/M/L | H/M/L | Yes/No |

### The "Guaranteed to Fail" Question

> If I were deliberately trying to make this fail, what would I do?


**Am I accidentally doing any of those things?**


---

## Part 4: What Am I Not Seeing?

### Blind Spots Check

**What contradicts my assumptions?**


**What information would change my mind?**


**What would a skeptic say?**


### Circle of Competence Check

> Is this within my area of expertise, or am I playing "amateur tennis" where 80% of points are lost to errors, not won by skill?

- [ ] Core competence (I know this domain well)
- [ ] Adjacent competence (I know related domains)
- [ ] Outside competence (I'm learning as I go)

**If outside competence**: Who should I consult before deciding?

## Part 6: Decision

### Synthesis Questions

## Reflection Questions

Before finalizing:
