# Assumption Audit: {{date}}

> [!ai-context]
> This template supports periodic review of beliefs driving major life and work commitments. Use quarterly or when major decisions are pending. Helps distinguish grounded reasoning from inherited convention.

## Purpose

Surface and challenge the assumptions underlying your major commitments, goals, and recurring activities. Identify 3-5 assumptions to actively test this period.

---

## Part 1: Commitment Inventory

### Major Life Commitments

List your significant ongoing commitments across life areas:

#### Career / Work
| Commitment | Time Investment | Why am I doing this? |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| | | |

| | | |

#### Relationships
| Commitment | Time Investment | Why am I doing this? |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| | | |

## Part 2: Assumption Classification

### For each commitment, classify the underlying belief:

| Commitment | Core Assumption | Classification | Confidence |
|------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| | | First Principles / Inherited / Unknown | 1-10 |
| | | First Principles / Inherited / Unknown | 1-10 |
| | | First Principles / Inherited / Unknown | 1-10 |
| | | First Principles / Inherited / Unknown | 1-10 |
| | | First Principles / Inherited / Unknown | 1-10 |

### Classification Guide

- **First Principles**: I've personally validated this through experience or evidence
- **Inherited**: This came from others (parents, culture, peers, media) without my verification
- **Unknown**: I'm not sure where this belief came from

## Part 3: Deep Dive Questions

For inherited or low-confidence assumptions, answer:

### Assumption 1: _______________

**Where did this belief come from?**


**What evidence supports it?**


**What evidence contradicts it?**


**What would change if this were false?**


**Is this physics (can't change) or psychology (can change)?**


---

### Assumption 2: _______________

**Where did this belief come from?**


**What evidence supports it?**


**What evidence contradicts it?**


**What would change if this were false?**


**Is this physics or psychology?**

### Assumption 3: _______________

**Where did this belief come from?**


**What evidence supports it?**


**What evidence contradicts it?**


**What would change if this were false?**


**Is this physics or psychology?**

## Part 4: Assumptions to Challenge This Period

Select 3-5 assumptions for active testing:

### Challenge 1

**Assumption**:

**Why challenge this?**


**Experiment to test it**:


**Success/Failure criteria**:


**Timeline**:

---

### Challenge 2

**Assumption**:

**Why challenge this?**


**Experiment to test it**:


**Success/Failure criteria**:


**Timeline**:

---

### Challenge 3

**Assumption**:

**Why challenge this?**


**Experiment to test it**:


**Success/Failure criteria**:


**Timeline**:

## Part 5: Elimination Candidates

### Commitments to Stop or Reduce

> What am I doing because "that's how it's done" vs. what actually serves my mission?

| Commitment | Why Eliminate/Reduce? | Action |
|------------|----------------------|--------|
| | | |
| | | |

### The Blank Slate Test

> If you had no current commitments, which of these would you actively choose to add?

**Would definitely add**:


**Would not add if starting fresh**:


**Unclear - needs more thought**:

## Part 6: Key Insights

### What patterns do I notice?


### What beliefs have I never questioned?


### What would the person I'm becoming believe differently?

## Reflection Questions

- [ ] What story am I telling myself that might not be true?
- [ ] What would I pursue if there were no social expectations?
- [ ] Am I pursuing goals because I genuinely want them or because they're expected?
- [ ] What "limitations" are actually just assumptions?
