# Five Whys Analysis: {{title}}

> [!ai-context]
> Quick technique to find root causes of any problem, limiting belief, or stuck situation. Stop when you reach either a falsifiable fact (first principle found) or "because I said so" (assumption exposed).

## The Problem or Belief

**State clearly**:


**Context**: When/where does this occur?


**Impact**: Why does this matter?


---

## The Five Whys

### Why 1: First-Level Reason

**Q**: Why is [problem/belief] happening/true?

**A**:


> Is this a fact or an assumption?

---

### Why 2: Deeper Reason

**Q**: Why is [answer 1] happening/true?

**A**:


> Is this a fact or an assumption?

---

### Why 3: Underlying Cause

**Q**: Why is [answer 2] happening/true?

**A**:


> Is this a fact or an assumption?

---

### Why 4: Root Assumption

**Q**: Why is [answer 3] happening/true?

**A**:


> Is this a fact or an assumption?

---

### Why 5: Fundamental Truth or Exposed Assumption

**Q**: Why is [answer 4] happening/true?

**A**:


> **STOP CHECK**: Did I reach:
> - [ ] A falsifiable fact (first principle found)
> - [ ] "Because I said so" or "That's just how it is" (assumption exposed)
> - [ ] "I can't" or "I need to" (probe: is this physics or psychology?)

## Analysis

### What Did We Find?

**Root cause identified**:


**Type**:
- [ ] First Principle (undeniable truth)
- [ ] Exposed Assumption (can be challenged)
- [ ] Constraint (real or artificial?)

### If Assumption Exposed:

**Where did this belief originate?**


**What would change if this assumption were false?**


**What experiment could test this assumption?**


### If First Principle Found:

**How does knowing this fundamental truth change my approach?**


---

## Action

### What Changes Now?

**Immediate action**:


**Longer-term change**:


**Who else needs to know?**:

## Quick Reference: Common Stopping Points

| Stopping Point | Meaning | Next Step |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| "That's physics" | Real constraint | Work within it |
| "That's the rule" | May be changeable | Question authority |
| "Everyone does it this way" | Convention | Consider alternatives |
| "I've always done it this way" | Habit | Experiment with change |
| "I'm afraid to..." | Psychology | Address the fear |
| "I don't have time/money" | Often assumption | Verify with data |
| "I can't" | Usually psychology | Challenge it |
