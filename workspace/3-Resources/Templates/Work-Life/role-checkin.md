## Role-Specific Reflection

### Provider Role
- Am I providing financial security aligned with family values?
- Am I modeling healthy work patterns?
- What does "enough" look like?

### Father Role
- Was I present during interactions, or just physically there?
- What did I model this week?
- What does {{child_name}} need from me right now?

### Partner Role
- Did I prioritize connection over efficiency?
- Did I communicate with warmth, not just clarity?
- What does {{partner_name}} need from me right now?

### Self Role
- Did I protect time for renewal?
- Am I treating self-care as selfish, or as the foundation for serving others?
- What do I need that I'm not giving myself permission to need?

## Integration Questions

Instead of "How do I split time between roles?" ask:

- How can my Provider role enrich my Father role this week?
- How can my Partner role strengthen my Professional role?
- Where can roles combine rather than compete?

> These are for self-coaching when patterns persist.

- "You said [role] matters most. Your actions show [different priority]. What's really going on?"
- "You committed to being present for [person]. You [contrary action]. Is this who you're becoming?"
- "Which roles are you avoiding? What fear is underneath that avoidance?"
