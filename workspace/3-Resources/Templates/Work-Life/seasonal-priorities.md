**On Alignment**:
- "Does this decision align with my seasonal priorities, or am I defaulting to habit?"
- "Is this opportunity for this season, or should it wait?"

**On Trade-Offs**:
- "What am I implicitly trading by saying yes to this?"
- "Is this trade-off aligned with my stated priorities, or is fear/habit driving it?"

**On Transitions**:
- "This season was supposed to end when X happened. X happened. Why am I still in this season?"
- "Am I holding onto a season because it's comfortable, even though it's no longer serving me?"
