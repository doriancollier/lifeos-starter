# Provider Weekly Review

*Week of: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}*

## Reflection

Before diving into metrics, pause. This role isn't about proving your worth through numbers—it's about expressing love through security and presence.

**This week, how did your work serve your family?**


## Financial Health

### Runway Awareness

*Does this give you peace of mind, or do you need to adjust something?*

## Presence Audit

The research is clear: quality beats quantity. But "quality" means *actually present*—not distracted, not thinking about work, not half-there.

### Family Connection
- [ ] Quality one-on-one time with {{child_name}} this week
- [ ] Quality connection time with {{partner_name}} this week
- [ ] Shared meals together (aim: 5+)
- [ ] Device-free family time (daily)

### Presence Quality
*Think back on your time together. Were you there, or just physically in the room?*

**Best moment of connection this week:**


**A moment where I was distracted or half-present:**

## Values Transmission

Providing isn't just earning—it's teaching. What did you model this week?

- [ ] Money conversation or teaching moment with {{child_name}}
- [ ] Work ethic made visible (not hidden)
- [ ] Included family in a decision

**What did you teach (intentionally or unintentionally) about money or work this week?**

## The Honest Questions

*Answer these for yourself. No one else will see them.*

1. **Did I balance providing and presence this week?**


2. **Where did I sacrifice presence for provision (or vice versa)?**


3. **Am I providing to express love, or to prove my worth?**


4. **What adjustment would make next week better?**


---

## Next Week

**One thing to protect:**


**One thing to improve:**

*Remember: Providing is an act of love. The goal isn't to accumulate—it's to create security so you can be present for what matters.*
