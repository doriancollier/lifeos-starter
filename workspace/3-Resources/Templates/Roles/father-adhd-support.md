# Executive Function Support Conversation

*Date: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}*

## Important Context

{{child_name}}'s prefrontal cortex development may be 30% behind neurotypical peers. At 15, his executive function might align more with a 10-11 year old. This isn't a character flaw—it's neurodevelopmental reality.

**Your role:** Support and scaffold, not judge or enable. Build his independence, not his dependence on you.

**The key:** He needs to feel ownership of his own brain and strategies. Collaborative, not directive.

---

## The Challenge

**What task or responsibility is he struggling with?**


**What does the struggle look like?** *(Procrastination? Overwhelm? Forgetting? Starting but not finishing?)*


---

## The Conversation

### 1. Identify (Curious, Not Critical)

*Ask with genuine curiosity, not frustration:*
- "What's the hardest part of getting this done?"
- "Where do you get stuck?"
- "What's getting in the way?"

**What he said:**


**What I noticed underneath:** *(Overwhelm? Fear of failure? Lack of interest? Unclear where to start?)*


### 2. Break Down (Collaborative)

*Work together to create next steps. Only 2-3 steps—not the whole plan.*

**First step:**


**Second step:**


**Third step (optional):**


*Did he help create these steps, or did I dictate them?*


### 3. Motivate (Use ADHD Brain Motivators)

Traditional "you should" motivation doesn't work with ADHD brains. The five motivators are:

| Motivator | How to apply |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Novelty** | Make it new, different, interesting |
| **Urgency** | Create real (not fake) deadlines |
| **Interest** | Connect to something he cares about |
| **Competition** | Add game element or challenge |
| **Enjoyment** | Make it fun somehow |

**Which motivator(s) might work here?**


**How can we frame this task using that motivator?**


### 4. Buy-In (Essential)

*Without buy-in, nothing works. He has to want to try.*

Ask: "Does this approach feel like it could work for you?"

**His response:**


**Did he seem genuinely on board, or just agreeing to end the conversation?**


### 5. Support Plan (Not Ownership)

*You're supporting, not owning. He needs to do the work.*

Ask: "What do you need from me?" and "When should we check in?"

**What support does he need?**
- [ ] Reminder at specific time
- [ ] Body double (work alongside)
- [ ] Check-in call/text
- [ ] Help with specific sub-task
- [ ] Accountability partner
- [ ] Something else:

**Check-in scheduled for:**


---

## Boundaries

### Things to Avoid
- [ ] Doing the task for him (enabling)
- [ ] Nagging or repeated reminders (creates dependence)
- [ ] Expressing disappointment in ways that create shame
- [ ] Comparing to neurotypical expectations
- [ ] Making this about your frustration

### Your Role
- [ ] Provide scaffolding, not solutions
- [ ] Celebrate effort and process, not just outcomes
- [ ] Stay calm even if it doesn't go perfectly
- [ ] Remember: this is hard for him, even when it "shouldn't" be

## Follow-Up

**Date of check-in:**


**Did the approach work?**


**What to try differently next time:**


**What worked well:**


---

## Learning His Profile

*Over time, track what helps and what doesn't:*

**Strategies that work for {{child_name}}:**


**Strategies that don't work:**


**His own insights about how he learns best:**


---

## Reflection

**Did I stay collaborative, or did I slip into lecture mode?**


**Did I respect his developmental reality, or judge him by neurotypical standards?**


**Did he leave this conversation feeling supported or shamed?**


---

*The goal isn't to fix him. The goal is to help him understand his own brain so he can advocate for himself. You're building his self-awareness and self-efficacy—not his dependence on you.*
