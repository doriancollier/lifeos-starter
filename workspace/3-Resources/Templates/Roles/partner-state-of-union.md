# State of Union

*Date: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}*

## Before You Begin

This isn't a business meeting. It's not an EMC check-in. This is about *your relationship*—the friendship, the partnership, the love.

The research shows couples who spend one hour per week on this kind of meeting transform their conflict management. It prevents issues from building and practices problem-solving as a team.

**Ground rules:**
- No phones
- No defensiveness—listen to understand
- This is us vs. the problem, not me vs. you
