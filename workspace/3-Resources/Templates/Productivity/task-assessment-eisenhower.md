# Task Assessment - Eisenhower Matrix

**Purpose**: Quickly categorize tasks by Urgent vs. Important to route to the correct action.

**Time**: 1-2 minutes per task | **Use**: When processing new tasks or unclear priorities

---

## Quick Assessment

### Task: _________________________________

**Step 1: Is this IMPORTANT to my goals/mission?**
- [ ] Yes - Advances my goals, roles, or mission
- [ ] No - Does not contribute to what matters

**Step 2: Is this URGENT with real consequences?**
- [ ] Yes - Genuine deadline or immediate need
- [ ] No - Can wait without real harm

---

## Quadrant Routing

| | URGENT | NOT URGENT |
|---|--------|------------|
| **IMPORTANT** | **Q1: DO** Crisis, deadline, emergency. Handle now. | **Q2: SCHEDULE** Strategic, preventive, growth. Protect time. |
| **NOT IMPORTANT** | **Q3: DELEGATE** Others' priorities, interruptions. Pass off. | **Q4: ELIMINATE** Time wasters, avoidance. Delete. |

### This task is: [ ] Q1 [ ] Q2 [ ] Q3 [ ] Q4

---

## Quadrant Actions

### Q1 (Urgent + Important): DO NOW
- [ ] Schedule immediately
- [ ] Clear distractions
- [ ] Execute with focus

**But ask**: Could Q2 prevention have avoided this crisis?

### Q2 (Not Urgent + Important): SCHEDULE
- [ ] Block dedicated time this week
- [ ] Protect from interruption
- [ ] Treat as sacred appointment

**Target**: 60-65% of productive time should be here.

### Q3 (Urgent + Not Important): DELEGATE
- [ ] Who can handle this? __________
- [ ] Can I batch with similar tasks?
- [ ] Can I automate or template?
- [ ] Can I say no?

**Remember**: 70% as good is good enough for delegation.

### Q4 (Not Urgent + Not Important): ELIMINATE
- [ ] Delete from list
- [ ] Add to Not-To-Do list
- [ ] Block the trigger

**Test**: "Will I feel better or worse after this?"

## Urgency Illusion Check

*Before accepting something as urgent, ask:*

- [ ] Is this truly urgent, or am I feeling pressured?
- [ ] Is this MY priority or someone else's?
- [ ] Is their poor planning becoming my emergency?
- [ ] What are the real consequences of waiting?

**If it's fake urgency**: Downgrade to Q2 or Q3.

## Batch Assessment

*For multiple tasks, use this quick grid:*

| Task | Important? | Urgent? | Quadrant | Action |
|------|------------|---------|----------|--------|
|      |            |         |          |        |
|      |            |         |          |        |
|      |            |         |          |        |
|      |            |         |          |        |
|      |            |         |          |        |

## Mapping to A/B/C Priorities

| Quadrant | Priority | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Q1 | A (urgent) | True emergencies only. Max 5 total A-tasks. |
| Q2 | A or B | Strategic work. Often the MOST important. |
| Q3 | C or Delegate | Do not mistake for A. Someone else's urgency. |
| Q4 | Eliminate | Not even C. Remove entirely. |

**Key Insight**: B-priorities (Q2 work) are often higher-leverage than A-priorities (Q1 crises). Protect them.

---

## Weekly Quadrant Check

*During weekly review, assess:*

- Q1 time this week: ___% (target: <25%)
- Q2 time this week: ___% (target: 60-65%)
- Q3 time this week: ___% (target: <15%)
- Q4 time this week: ___% (target: 0%)

**Which Q1 crises could Q2 work have prevented?**
