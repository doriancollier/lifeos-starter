## Q4 Activities to Eliminate

*These are NOT urgent and NOT important. They drain time and energy without contributing to goals.*

### Digital Time Sinks

| Activity | Trigger Situation | Q2 Replacement |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
|          |                   |                |
|          |                   |                |
|          |                   |                |

### Low-Value Habits

| Habit | When It Happens | Better Alternative |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
|       |                 |                   |
|       |                 |                   |
|       |                 |                   |

### Energy Drains

| Activity | Why I Do It | Why I'm Stopping |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
|          |             |                  |
|          |             |                  |

*Before engaging in potential Q4 activity, ask:*

**"Will I feel better or worse after this?"**

| Example: Reading fiction | Procrastination | Renewal | Q2 - Keep |
|          |            |             |         |
|          |            |             |         |
