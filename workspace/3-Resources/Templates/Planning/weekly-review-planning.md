> [!tip] When to use
> Complete every Friday, 3-4 PM (or your preferred weekly review time). Block this as a recurring non-negotiable appointment. Total time: 60 minutes (30 review + 30 planning). If you miss a week, do an abbreviated 15-minute version — never skip entirely. Consistency beats perfection.
