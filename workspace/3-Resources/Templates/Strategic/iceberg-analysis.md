# Iceberg Analysis

> [!ai-context]
> Use this template to move from reactive symptom-treatment to proactive root-cause intervention. The Iceberg Model reveals that visible events (10%) sit atop patterns, structures, and mental models (90% hidden).

## The Event (Surface Level - 10%)

### What Just Happened?

**Event Description:**

_Describe the specific incident, symptom, or problem that triggered this analysis_

**When did it occur?**

**Impact:**

---

## Level 1: Patterns (Below Surface)

### What Trends Show This Over Time?

**How often does this happen?**

| Frequency | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| First time | [ ] |
| Rarely (1-2 times/year) | [ ] |
| Occasionally (monthly) | [ ] |
| Regularly (weekly) | [ ] |
| Frequently (daily) | [ ] |

**Pattern Recognition:**

| Question | Response |
|----------|----------|
| When does this typically occur? | |
| What conditions precede it? | |
| What usually follows? | |
| Who else is involved in the pattern? | |

**Similar past events:**

1.
2.
3.

**The Pattern Statement:**

_"Every time [trigger], [event] tends to happen, leading to [consequence]."_

---

## Level 2: Structures (Deeper)

### What Creates This Pattern?

**Feedback Loops Involved:**

| Loop Type | Description | Effect |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Reinforcing | | Amplifies |
| Balancing | | Stabilizes |

**Incentive Structures:**

_What rewards or punishes the behavior in this pattern?_

| Behavior | Incentive | Result |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| | | |
| | | |

**System Rules in Play:**

_What explicit or implicit rules govern this situation?_

-
-
-

**Information Flows:**

| Information | Available? | To Whom? | Impact |
|-------------|------------|----------|--------|
| | Yes/No | | |
| | Yes/No | | |

**Physical/Environmental Factors:**

## Level 3: Mental Models (Deepest - 90%)

### What Beliefs Create This Structure?

**Underlying Assumptions:**

_What do I/we believe that makes this structure seem reasonable?_

1.
2.
3.

**Question Each Assumption:**

| Assumption | Is it true? | Evidence for | Evidence against |
|------------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Origin of These Beliefs:**

_Where did these mental models come from?_

- Cultural norms:
- Past experiences:
- Role models/authorities:
- Fear/protection:

**The Core Mental Model:**

_Distill to one foundational belief driving this entire iceberg_

## Intervention Selection

### At What Level Should I Intervene?

| Level | Intervention Type | Durability | Effort | Recommended? |
|-------|------------------|------------|--------|--------------|
| Event | React, firefight | Low | Low | Only for emergencies |
| Pattern | Anticipate, prevent | Medium | Medium | For recurring issues |
| Structure | Redesign systems | High | High | For persistent problems |
| Mental Model | Transform thinking | Highest | Highest | For fundamental change |

**Selected Level:**

**Why this level?**

---

## New Mental Model

### Belief Transformation

**Current Mental Model:**

_"I believe..."_

**Problems with Current Model:**

**New Mental Model:**

_"What if instead I believed..."_

**Evidence Supporting New Model:**

**How New Model Changes:**
- Structures:
- Patterns:
- Events:

## Action Plan

### Immediate (Event Level)

_Address the current symptom_

- [ ]

### Short-term (Pattern Level)

_Prevent recurrence_

- [ ]
- [ ]

### Medium-term (Structure Level)

_Redesign systems_

- [ ]
- [ ]

### Long-term (Mental Model Level)

_Transform thinking_

## Integration

### How will I reinforce the new mental model?

| Method | Frequency | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Journaling/reflection | | |
| Environmental cues | | |
| Accountability | | |
| Practice/repetition | | |

### Warning Signs (Old Model Resurfacing)

_What signals that I'm reverting to old thinking?_

## Review Schedule

| Date | Question | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| +1 week | Has the event recurred? | |
| +1 month | Is the pattern changing? | |
| +3 months | Are structures shifting? | |
| +6 months | Has mental model integrated? | |
