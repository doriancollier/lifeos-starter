# Via Negativa Audit

> [!ai-context]
> Use this template to identify what to remove rather than add. Via Negativa is the principle that improvement often comes through removing harm rather than adding solutions. "Knowledge grows by subtraction."

## Audit Date: {{date}}

## Core Principle

> "It is easier to identify and remove what's harmful than to find and add what's perfect. The learning of life is about what to avoid."
