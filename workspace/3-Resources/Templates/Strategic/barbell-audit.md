# Barbell Audit

> [!ai-context]
> Use this template for quarterly review of life portfolio balance. The barbell strategy combines extreme safety (90%) with extreme risk-taking (10%) while avoiding the dangerous "middle" of moderate risk. This ensures survival while maintaining exposure to unlimited upside.

## Audit Date: {{date}}

## Core Principle

> "The barbell isn't about becoming rich--it's about staying rich and surviving long enough to capture positive Black Swans."

## Reference: The Barbell Principle

### Why Avoid the Middle?
- Moderate risk feels safe but is most susceptible to catastrophic measurement errors
- You get neither the security of safety nor the upside of speculation
- "Picking up pennies in front of a steamroller" - small gains, catastrophic losses

### Examples of Dangerous Middle
- Job that pays okay but has no growth + no safety
- Investments with moderate returns but significant downside
- Commitments that take moderate time but deliver moderate value
- Relationships with moderate investment and moderate return

### Signs of Good Barbell
- Can survive complete failure of risky bets
- Risky bets have unlimited upside potential
- Safe end truly is safe (liquid, reliable, proven)
- Clear separation--nothing in the middle
