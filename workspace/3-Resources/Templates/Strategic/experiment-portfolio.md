# Experiment Portfolio

> [!ai-context]
> Use this template to track a portfolio of small bets following the 7-2-1 framework for asymmetric experimentation. The goal is to maintain multiple low-cost experiments with outsized upside potential.

## Portfolio Date: {{date}}

## The 7-2-1 Framework

> **7** Small Risky Bets: Low probability, huge upside (10% success, 100x return)
> **2** Medium Bets: Medium probability, good upside (30% success, 10x return)
> **1** Big Safe Bet: Higher probability, moderate upside (70% success, 2-3x return)

## Reference: Experiment Principles

### Good Experiments Have:
- **Limited Downside**: Worst case is loss of time/money invested
- **Unlimited Upside**: Success could be transformational
- **Fast Feedback**: Know if it's working within weeks, not years
- **Clear Kill Criteria**: Define failure before starting
- **Learning Value**: Insights even from failure

### Signs of Bad Experiments:
- Requires success to survive (ruin risk)
- No clear success/failure criteria
- Sunk cost driving continuation
- All-or-nothing commitment
- Success depends on things outside your control

### Graduation Criteria:
- Consistent results over multiple cycles
- Clear path to 10x scaling
- Sustainable at increased investment
- Doesn't compromise safe end of barbell
