# {{project_name}} Retrospective

> [!ai-context]
> This is a blameless project postmortem. Focus on what allowed outcomes to happen (systems thinking), not who caused them. Duration: 90-120 minutes.

> [!quote] Prime Directive
> Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.
