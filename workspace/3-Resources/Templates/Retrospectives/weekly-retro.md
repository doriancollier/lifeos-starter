> [!ai-context]
> This is a weekly retrospective using the 3 Ls format (Liked, Learned, Lacked). Focus on pattern recognition and course correction rather than exhaustive event logging. Limit action items to 1-3 SMART items.

> [!quote] Prime Directive
> Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.
