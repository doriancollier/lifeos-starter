# Goal Bingo Prize Pool

All prizes are mixed into a single pool. More small prizes = higher odds of small wins, but every draw has a chance at something big!

## How It Works

1. Write each prize on a slip of paper
2. Mix all slips together in a jar or bowl
3. When you earn a draw, pick without looking
4. Celebrate and redeem!
5. Return slip to pool (prizes can repeat)
