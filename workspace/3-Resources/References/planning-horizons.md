# Planning Horizons Reference

How the planning system connects from annual vision to daily execution.

---

## The Cascade

```
Foundation (Identity/Mission/Vision)
    ↓
Annual (3-5 goals, yearly theme)
    ↓
Quarterly (3-5 rocks, 90-day focus)
    ↓
Monthly (theme, milestones)
    ↓
Weekly (Big 3, role-based rocks)
    ↓
Daily (A/B/C priorities)
```

The Complete Cascade Framework connects identity to execution through five layers:

| Layer | Focus | Horizon | Key Question |
|-------|-------|---------|--------------|
| Foundation | Who you are | Lifetime | "What matters most?" |
| Annual | Where you're going | 12 months | "What will this year be about?" |
| Quarterly | What you'll accomplish | 90 days | "What must happen to stay on track?" |
| Monthly | How you'll progress | 30 days | "What milestones advance the quarter?" |
| Weekly | What you'll prioritize | 7 days | "What Big Rocks get scheduled first?" |
| Daily | What you'll execute | Today | "Which A-tasks move the needle?" |

**The Single Question**: At each level, ask "How does this support the level above?"

---

## Foundation Layer

### Purpose
The identity layer provides the "why" that grounds all planning. Without it, goals become arbitrary achievements rather than expressions of purpose.

### Components
- **Mission**: Your unique contribution to the world
- **Vision**: A vivid picture of your future self (written in present tense)
- **Values**: 1-2 primary values with supporting/slippery behaviors
- **BHAG**: 10-25 year "Big Hairy Audacious Goal"
- **Principles**: Operating guidelines for decisions

### Review Cadence
- Full review: Annually (during annual planning)
- Quick check: Quarterly (does this still feel true?)

### Key Questions
- "Does my mission still feel true? Am I living it daily?"
- "Am I closer to my vision than a year ago?"
- "Are my stated values and lived values aligned?"
- "What do my calendar and spending say my actual values are?"

### Reference
- [[foundation]] — Identity, mission, vision, principles

---

## Annual Planning

### Purpose
Set direction for the year through a theme and 3-5 goals that advance your vision. Annual planning is about "what" you'll accomplish and "why" it matters.

### Cadence
- **Full review**: December/January
- **Mid-year check**: July
- **Duration**: 4-8 hours for full annual review

### Key Elements

**Yearly Theme**
A single word or phrase that serves as a decision filter:
- Applies to ALL life domains (not just work)
- Flexible and adaptable as circumstances change
- Posted visibly in multiple locations
- Used to filter opportunities: "Does this align with my theme?"

**3-5 Annual Goals**
- Maximum of 5 to force ruthless prioritization
- Each goal connects to a life domain or role
- Includes measurable success criteria
- Broken into quarterly milestones

**"NOT Doing" List**
- Explicit list of good things you're saying no to
- Prevents the "same but more" fallacy
- Every goal addition requires a trade-off

**Role Balance Check**
Rate each role (Father, Husband, Professional, Self) on:
- Current state vs. desired state
- Time/energy allocation
- Priority actions needed

### Templates
- [[annual-plan]] — Goal setting and theme selection
- [[annual-review]] — Year-end reflection (wins, lessons, patterns)
- [[annual-retro]] — YearCompass-style deep retrospective

### Key Questions

**For Reflection**:
- "What did I learn about what really matters this year?"
- "When did I feel most aligned? What values were present?"
- "What would I do differently if I could repeat the year?"

**For Planning**:
- "If anything were possible, what would I achieve in each life domain?"
- "Does this theme apply to all areas of my life?"
- "What am I putting down to pick this up?" (for every new goal)
- "Is this a stretch goal (aspirational) or a SMART goal (concrete milestone)?"

---

## Quarterly Planning

### Purpose
The "Goldilocks" cadence — long enough to accomplish meaningful work, short enough to maintain focus. Quarterly planning is the critical bridge between annual vision and monthly execution.

### Why 90 Days Works
- Annual feels distant (enables procrastination)
- Weekly lacks strategic depth
- 90 days is the "productivity sweet spot" where your brain can visualize success
- Organizations with quarterly reviews achieve 70-80% goal completion vs. 30% without

### Cadence
- **Plan**: Start of quarter (2-4 hours)
- **Mid-quarter check**: Week 6-7
- **Review**: End of quarter (2-4 hours)
- **Retreat** (optional): 1-2 days away for deep planning

### Key Elements

**3-5 Quarterly Rocks**
The Big Rock metaphor: if you put sand in the jar first, rocks won't fit.
- Maximum of 5 rocks (ruthless focus)
- Each rock has ONE owner (accountability)
- Each rock connects to an annual goal
- Include measurable Key Results

**Lead vs. Lag Indicators**
- **Lag indicators**: End results (what you're trying to achieve)
- **Lead indicators**: Actions you take (what you control)
- Track lead indicators weekly (5-10 total actions)
- If leads are 85%+ but lags aren't moving: wrong strategy
- If leads are low: execution problem

**Monthly Milestones**
Break each quarterly rock into 3 monthly checkpoints.

**Red/Yellow/Green Status**
Weekly tracking of each rock:
- Green: On track
- Yellow: At risk, needs attention
- Red: Off track, intervention required

### Templates
- [[quarterly-plan]] — Set rocks, Key Results, milestones
- [[quarterly-review]] — Assess progress, capture learnings
- [[quarterly-retreat-agenda]] — Structure for 1-2 day retreat
- [[quarterly-retro]] — Deep retrospective format

### Key Questions

**For Review**:
- "What progress did you make toward your 3-5 priorities?"
- "What went well that you should repeat?"
- "What ONE thing you control held you back?"
- "What assumptions were wrong?"

**For Planning**:
- "Looking at annual goals, what must happen THIS quarter?"
- "What good opportunities are you saying NO to?"
- "For each priority: What does 'done' look like?"
- "What does 'on track' look like at week 4, week 8, week 12?"

**For Mid-Quarter (Week 6-7)**:
- "Are your 30-day milestones being hit?"
- "Do any priorities need adjustment based on new information?"
- "What's your biggest blocker right now?"

---

## Monthly Planning

### Purpose
The strategic bridge between weekly tactical execution and quarterly goals. Monthly provides the "just right" rhythm for meaningful progress and course correction.

### Why Monthly Matters
- Weekly reviews miss role imbalance patterns
- Quarterly goals drift without check-ins
- Monthly connects daily work to bigger outcomes
- ~10 hours/month investment (4% of time) provides clarity for the other 96%

### Cadence
- **Review**: Last Sunday of month (60-90 minutes)
- **Planning**: Same session or next day (60-90 minutes)
- **Duration**: 2-3 hours total

### Key Elements

**Two Distinct Phases**
1. **Review** (backward-looking): What worked, what didn't, why
2. **Planning** (forward-looking): Focus areas, milestones, intentions

**Monthly Focus Areas**
- 3-5 maximum (prevents overwhelm)
- Use RPM format: Result, Purpose, Massive Action Plan
- Include both professional (1-2) and personal (1-2) areas

**Monthly Theme**
Flexible direction alongside specific goals:
- Goals create accountability
- Themes allow exploration without binary success/failure

**Role Balance Assessment**
- Rate each role: time spent, satisfaction (1-10), needs more/less attention
- Surface the question: "Which role is being neglected that matters deeply?"

### Templates
- [[monthly-plan]] — Focus areas, milestones, intentions
- [[monthly-review]] — Reflection, goal progress, patterns
- [[monthly-retro]] — Retrospective format

### Key Questions

**For Review**:
- "What am I most proud of from this month?"
- "What drained my energy? What energized me?"
- "Where did my time actually go vs. where I said it would go?"
- "Which quarterly goals got no attention? Why?"
- "Where's the gap between philosophy and action?"

**For Planning**:
- "What do I really want to accomplish this month?" (Result)
- "Why do I want this? What will it give me?" (Purpose)
- "What are the key actions to get there?" (Massive Action)
- "Am I being productive or just busy?"
- "At the end of this month, how will I know I succeeded?"

---

## Weekly Planning

### Purpose
The linchpin connecting quarterly strategy to daily execution. A week is "short enough to control, but long enough to be flexible."

### Why Weekly Works
- Monthly is too big for the mind to grasp
- Daily is too narrow to see the big picture
- Weekly is the optimal unit for intentional progress
- 30 minutes of weekly planning transforms productivity everywhere

### Cadence
- **Review**: End of week (30-45 minutes)
- **Planning**: Same session (30-45 minutes)
- **Duration**: 60-90 minutes total
- **Recommended time**: Friday afternoon

### Key Elements

**Review Before Planning**
Clear the past (reflection, inbox processing) BEFORE planning the next week:
- Process ALL inboxes before opening calendar
- Capture wins/losses/lessons before deciding direction
- Energy audit before time blocking

**Big 3 for the Week**
- The 1-3 things that, if accomplished, would make you proud of the week
- Scheduled FIRST, before any other commitments
- Everything else (gravel) fills the gaps
- Ask: "If I only accomplished these 3 things, would I be satisfied?"

**Role-Based Rocks**
Map Big Rocks to roles:
- Father
- Husband
- {{company_1_name}}
- {{company_2_name}}
- EMC
- Self

**Energy Audit**
- Rate energy 1-10
- List drains and deposits
- Adjustment for next week
- Watch for grip stress (INTJ-specific: impulsive behavior = need solitude)

### Templates
- [[weekly-review-planning]] — Combined review and planning structure
- [[weekly-retro]] — Weekly retrospective format
- [[weekly-leverage-audit]] — Efficiency analysis

### Key Questions

**For Review**:
- "What went well this week? What am I proud of?"
- "What didn't go as planned? What felt overwhelming?"
- "What patterns am I noticing across recent weeks?"
- "What am I avoiding? Why?"

**For Planning**:
- "What are the 3 things that would make this week a success?"
- "Which of these aligns most with my quarterly goals?"
- "What will I say 'no' to this week to protect my Big 3?"
- "Did I over-prioritize professional work last week?" (known bias)

---

## Daily Planning

### Purpose
Execute the week's priorities through A/B/C task prioritization and time blocking. Daily planning refines weekly direction into hourly action.

### Cadence
- **Morning planning**: 10-15 minutes
- **End-of-day review**: 5-10 minutes

### Key Elements

**A/B/C Priorities**
| Priority | Symbol | Meaning | Limit |
|----------|--------|---------|-------|
| A | Red | Must complete today | Max 5, numbered 1-5 |
| B | Yellow | Should complete today | No limit |
| C | Green | Nice to have | No limit |
| Blocked | Blue | Waiting on external | Include "Waiting for:" |

**Connection to Weekly**
- Daily A-tasks should flow from Weekly Big 3
- At least one A-task advances a weekly rock
- End-of-day review identifies what rolls forward vs. drops

**Time Blocking**
- Schedule Big Rock work during peak energy
- Build buffer time for the unexpected
- Protect creative/deep work from interruptions

### Key Questions

**Morning**:
- "What's the ONE thing today that would make everything else easier?"
- "How will I embody my core values today?"
- "Which weekly rock does today's plan advance?"

**Before Tasks**:
- "Does this support my mission, or is it drift?"
- "Am I being productive or just busy?"
- "Is this a big rock or gravel?"

**Evening**:
- "Did I live my values today? Where did I slip?"
- "Did I advance my big rocks or just handle gravel?"
- "What would I do differently tomorrow?"

## Cross-Horizon Connections

### Alignment Check Table

| When Planning | Reference | Key Question |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| Daily | Weekly Big 3 | "Which rock does this advance?" |
| Weekly | Quarterly rocks | "Am I on track for Q goals?" |
| Monthly | Quarterly progress | "Are milestones being hit?" |
| Quarterly | Annual goals | "What must happen to stay on track?" |
| Annual | Foundation | "Does this serve my mission/vision?" |

### Cascading Accountability

**From Top Down**:
- Mission/Vision sets direction
- Annual theme filters opportunities
- Quarterly rocks define "what success looks like"
- Monthly milestones create checkpoints
- Weekly Big 3 focus attention
- Daily A-tasks drive execution

**From Bottom Up**:
- Daily completions feed weekly progress
- Weekly reviews inform monthly adjustments
- Monthly patterns shape quarterly pivots
- Quarterly results determine annual success
- Annual achievements express mission/vision

### Warning Signs of Disconnection

| Sign | Level Problem | Fix |
|------|---------------|-----|
| Busy but not progressing | Daily disconnected from weekly | Align A-tasks to Big 3 |
| Goals drifting | Weekly disconnected from quarterly | Review rocks weekly |
| Quarterly goals off track | Monthly milestones missing | Add mid-month check-in |
| Annual goals feel stale | Quarterly not updating annual | Quarterly foundation check |
| Everything feels meaningless | Annual disconnected from foundation | Revisit mission/vision |

## Review Rhythms Summary

| Horizon | Duration | Frequency | Focus | Key Artifact |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Daily | 10-15 min | Daily | Execution | A/B/C task list |
| Weekly | 60-90 min | Weekly | Tactical | Big 3 priorities |
| Monthly | 2-3 hours | Monthly | Progress | Focus areas + milestones |
| Quarterly | 2-4 hours | 4x/year | Strategic | 3-5 rocks + KRs |
| Annual | 4-8 hours | 1x/year | Direction | Theme + 3-5 goals |

### Cumulative Investment
- Daily: ~2 hours/week (10-15 min x 7)
- Weekly: ~1 hour/week
- Monthly: ~3 hours/month
- Quarterly: ~12 hours/year
- Annual: ~8 hours/year

**Total**: ~250 hours/year (~5 hours/week)
**Return**: Clarity on how every minute connects to what matters most

---

## Implementation Guidance

### Starting Point
If new to multi-horizon planning, build from daily outward:
1. **Week 1-2**: Establish daily A/B/C discipline
2. **Week 3-4**: Add weekly Big 3 planning
3. **Month 2**: Add monthly review/planning
4. **Quarter 2**: Add quarterly rocks
5. **Year 2**: Full annual planning cycle

### Consistency Over Perfection
- A short, consistent review beats sporadic deep reviews
- If you miss a week, do abbreviated 15-minute version
- Never skip entirely — the habit matters more than duration
- Track completion rate (target: 4/4 weeks per month)

### Common Pitfalls

**Over-Planning**
- Reviews become bureaucracy rather than clarity
- Solution: Time-box strictly; if review takes >60 min, you're doing work, not reviewing

**Under-Connecting**
- Layers exist but don't reference each other
- Solution: Every lower layer explicitly names which upper layer it serves

**Same But More Fallacy**
- Adding goals without trade-offs
- Solution: For every addition, name what you're stopping
