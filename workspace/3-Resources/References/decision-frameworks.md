# Decision Frameworks Reference

Structured approaches for making better decisions. This guide synthesizes first principles thinking, inversion, mental models, asymmetric returns analysis, pre-mortems, and strategic thinking into actionable frameworks.

## Decision Type Assessment

Before applying a framework, categorize the decision.

### One-Way vs Two-Way Doors (Bezos)

**One-Way Door (Type 1)** - Irreversible or very hard to reverse
- Examples: Major career change, having children, selling a business, breaking a partnership
- Approach: Slow down, gather information, run pre-mortem, consult advisors, consider smaller experiments

**Two-Way Door (Type 2)** - Easily reversible with minimal cost
- Examples: Most product features, hiring (with trial), new projects, testing a side business
- Approach: Decide quickly with 70% of desired information, set review trigger, iterate

**Key Insight**: Many one-way doors can be converted to two-way doors by running smaller experiments first.

### Stakes Assessment Matrix

| Stakes | Reversible (Two-Way) | Irreversible (One-Way) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **High** | Decide in 24-48 hours | Full analysis, pre-mortem, Board of Advisors |
| **Low** | Decide immediately | Quick inversion check, then decide |

## Framework 1: First Principles Analysis

**When to use**: Novel problems, "this is how it's always done" situations, breakthrough needed, annual planning

### The Three-Step Framework

**Step 1: Identify and Question Assumptions**
- List everything you believe about the situation
- Ask "Why?" for each belief
- Classify: fundamental truth vs. inherited convention

**Step 2: Deconstruct to Fundamental Truths**
- Strip away convention, tradition, analogy
- What remains that is undeniably true?
- Distinguish function (what job it does) from form (current implementation)

**Step 3: Rebuild from Fundamentals**
- What would you design from scratch given only fundamental truths?
- Create the simplest possible solution
- Test against reality

### The Five Whys Method

Drill past symptoms to root causes:
1. State the problem
2. Ask "Why?" repeatedly until you hit:
   - A falsifiable fact (first principle found!)
   - "That's just how it is" (assumption revealed!)

**Example**: "I need to work 60 hours/week" -> Why? -> "Too much to do" -> Why? -> "Too many commitments" -> Why? -> "I say yes to everything" -> Why? -> "Fear of missing opportunities" -> **Root**: FOMO drives overcommitment

### Key Questions

- "What would I do if starting completely from scratch today?"
- "What assumptions might not be true?"
- "Am I optimizing for the outcome or following what others do?"
- "Which constraints are fundamental vs. artificial?"

## Framework 2: Inversion (Pre-Mortem)

**When to use**: Before major commitments, when overconfidence is likely, planning sessions, opportunities that look "too good"

### The Core Principle

> "It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent." - Charlie Munger

Instead of "How do I succeed?" ask "How do I guarantee failure?" Then systematically avoid those behaviors.

### Failure Pre-Mortem Process

**1. Setup**: State the decision; set future date (6-12 months out)

**2. Time Travel**: "It is [date]. This has failed spectacularly. I deeply regret this choice."

**3. Generate Failure Reasons**: Aim for 10-15 specific ways it could fail. Include uncomfortable possibilities and things you're avoiding.

**4. Categorize: Tigers, Paper Tigers, Elephants**

| Category | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Tiger** | Clear threat that will hurt if unaddressed | Mitigation plan immediately |
| **Paper Tiger** | Apparent threat you're not worried about | Acknowledge and monitor |
| **Elephant** | What you're avoiding discussing | Surface and address first |

**Key Insight**: Elephants are often the actual causes of failure. The things we avoid discussing are frequently the most dangerous.

**5. Mitigate**: For each Tiger, assign preventive action, owner, deadline, success metric, early warning signs

**6. Decide**: Proceed / Proceed with modifications / Delay until [condition] / Abandon

### Double-Barreled Pre-Mortem (for life decisions)

Run TWO scenarios:
1. **Failure**: "I did this and it failed. What went wrong?"
2. **Regret**: "I didn't do this and I regret it. What did I miss?"

### Key Questions

- "How could this fail spectacularly?"
- "What would I tell my best friend to avoid here?"
- "What elephant is in the room?"
- "Is this confidence or overconfidence?"

## Framework 3: Asymmetric Opportunity Evaluation

**When to use**: Investment decisions, career opportunities, new ventures, any risk vs. reward decision

### The Core Principle

Structure choices so potential gains significantly exceed potential losses. Never take bets that can wipe you out, regardless of how favorable the odds appear.

### The Evaluation Process

**Step 1: Calculate Maximum Downside**
- What is the absolute worst outcome?
- How long would recovery take?
- **Ruin Check**: Would failure wipe you out financially, reputationally, or energetically?

**Critical Rule**: If any dimension shows ruin risk, this is an automatic NO.

**Step 2: Assess Upside Potential**
- What is the realistic best outcome?
- Does success create compounding returns?
- What doors does this open?

**Step 3: Check Asymmetry Ratio**

| Ratio | Assessment | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| < 1:1 | Negative asymmetry | Decline |
| 1:1 - 3:1 | Modest | Needs strong other justification |
| 3:1 - 10:1 | Good asymmetry | Serious consideration |
| > 10:1 | Excellent | Strong candidate |

**Step 4: Verify Survival**
"Can I survive the worst case?" No = do not proceed.

**Step 5: Consider Optionality**
- What future options does this create vs. foreclose?
- Can I exit early if it's not working?

### The Barbell Strategy

| Allocation | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| 90% | Safe | Survival, preserved capital, stable income |
| 10% | Speculative | Unlimited upside potential |
| 0% | Middle | Moderate risk feels safe but is most dangerous |

### Via Negativa: Remove Before Adding

Before pursuing a new opportunity:
- "What problem am I trying to solve by adding this?"
- "Could I solve that problem by removing something instead?"

### The One Reason Rule

> "If you need more than one reason to do something, just don't do it." - Taleb

If listing 5 reasons why something is good, you might be convincing yourself.

### Key Questions

- "Can I survive the worst case?"
- "Is the ratio at least 3:1?"
- "Should I remove something instead of adding this?"
- "Is there ONE good reason, or am I rationalizing?"

## Framework 4: Second-Order Thinking

**When to use**: Any decision with ripple effects, before difficult conversations, evaluating habits, career decisions

### The Core Principle

Most regrets come from first-order thinking without considering consequences. Many extraordinary outcomes are first-order negative but second-order positive (exercise: pain now, health later).

### The Process

| Order | Question | Timeframe |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 1st | What happens immediately? | Now - 1 month |
| 2nd | What chain reactions follow? | 1-3 years |
| 3rd | What long-term effects emerge? | 3-10 years |

### The 10-10-10 Rule

- How will I feel in **10 minutes**?
- How will I feel in **10 months**?
- How will I feel in **10 years**?

### Key Questions

- "And then what?" (Keep asking until you've mapped 3 orders)
- "If I do this consistently, what will my life look like in 10 years?"
- "What does this compound into over time?"

## Framework 5: Strategic Patience vs. Urgency

**When to use**: Feeling pressured to act immediately, unsure whether to wait or move

### Distinguishing Test

| Waiting Because... | Type | Action |
|-------------------|------|--------|
| Unclear or overwhelmed | Indecision | Address the uncertainty |
| Defined signal/condition tied to objective | Strategy | Continue waiting |

### The S.T.O.P. Method

1. **Signal** - What triggered this sense of urgency?
2. **Time** - Can I create space before responding?
3. **Orient** - What's actually happening?
4. **Proceed** - Do I have clarity to act, or am I reacting?

### Warning Signs of Over-Waiting

Repeated hesitation, growing anxiety, external pressure building, opportunity decay, stagnation

## Quick Decision Filters

| Filter | Question | If Yes | If No |
|--------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Regret Minimization** | "Will I regret NOT doing this at 80?" | Lean yes | Reconsider |
| **10-10-10** | "How will I feel in 10 min/months/years?" | Long-term | Short-term |
| **Hell Yes or No** | "Is this a HELL YES?" | Do it | Say no |
| **Focus Filter** | "Does this align with current priorities?" | Proceed | Defer |
| **Inversion** | "What would guarantee failure?" | Avoid | Proceed |
| **One Reason** | "Is there ONE good reason?" | Proceed | Reconsider |

## Decision Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any major decision:

### Pre-Decision Checks
- [ ] Is this one-way or two-way door?
- [ ] Have I considered what could go wrong? (Inversion)
- [ ] Is the upside-to-downside ratio at least 3:1?
- [ ] Can I survive the worst case?
- [ ] Am I thinking from first principles or copying?
- [ ] What are the 2nd and 3rd order effects?
- [ ] Does this align with my values and mission?
- [ ] Who should I consult?

### Bias Checks
- [ ] Is this confidence or overconfidence?
- [ ] Am I continuing because of sunk cost or future value?
- [ ] Am I doing this because everyone else is?
- [ ] Am I listing many reasons (convincing myself)?

## Combining Frameworks

### For One-Way Door Decisions
1. First Principles - Question assumptions
2. Pre-Mortem - Identify failure modes
3. Asymmetric Evaluation - Calculate risk/reward
4. Second-Order Thinking - Map consequences
5. Board of Advisors - External perspective

### For Two-Way Door Decisions
1. Quick Inversion - "What would guarantee failure?"
2. Reversibility Confirm - "Can I undo this?"
3. Decide and set review trigger

### For Opportunity Evaluation
1. Asymmetric Evaluation (primary)
2. Pre-Mortem for Tigers
3. First Principles if conventional approach seems wrong

### For Planning Sessions
1. Via Negativa - "What should I stop?"
2. Inversion - "What would guarantee failure?"
3. First Principles - "What would I design from scratch?"
4. Second-Order - "What compounds over time?"

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Analysis Paralysis | Never deciding | Set deadline, accept 70% info |
| Rationalizing | Listing many reasons | One Reason Rule |
| Ignoring Elephants | Avoiding uncomfortable topics | Explicitly ask "What's the elephant?" |
| Form Over Function | Improving process, not questioning goal | First Principles |
| Treating All Equal | Same process for everything | Categorize first |
| Sunk Cost | "We've invested too much" | "Would I start this today?" |
