# Role Failure Modes Reference

Systematic identification of how each role can fail, enabling proactive prevention.

> "All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there." — Charlie Munger

This document applies inversion thinking to life roles. Instead of asking "How do I succeed?", we ask "How would this role fail?" and then avoid those failure modes.

---

## How to Use This Reference

1. **Weekly review**: Scan failure modes for each active role. Ask: "Am I drifting toward any of these?"
2. **If yes**: Apply the prevention strategy immediately
3. **Monthly review**: Rate proximity (1-10) to each failure mode
4. **Quarterly review**: Do deeper assessment across all roles
5. **Before major decisions**: Check if the decision increases proximity to any failure mode

### Proximity Scale

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 1-3 | Safe — behavior is opposite of failure mode |
| 4-6 | Watch — some drift, needs attention |
| 7-8 | Warning — active course correction needed |
| 9-10 | Danger — failure mode is occurring |

## Provider Role

The Provider role encompasses both earning capacity AND presence. Providing is an act of love—not merely financial obligation.

### Failure Mode 1: Work Becomes Identity (Not Service)

**Signs**:
- Working for ego validation rather than family service
- Accumulation for its own sake, not family security
- Can't stop even when "enough" has been achieved
- Self-worth entirely contingent on income level
- Feeling worthless when not earning

**Root cause**: Provider identity without service purpose. Earning becomes about proving worth rather than expressing love.

**Prevention**:
- Weekly check: "How does this work serve my family?"
- Track time with family vs. time earning—are both growing?
- Ask before major career decisions: "Does this serve my family or just my ego?"
- Build identity markers beyond income (father, partner, learner)

**Recovery prompt**: "Am I building wealth as love or accumulation as validation? What would change if my income halved tomorrow—would I still feel like a worthy person?"

---

### Failure Mode 2: Absent Provider

**Signs**:
- Consistently missing family moments for work
- "I'll make it up later" becomes chronic pattern
- Physical presence without mental presence
- Work justification: "I'm doing this for them"
- Children/partner stop asking for your time

**Root cause**: False belief that earning substitutes for presence. Rationalization that future time will compensate for present absence.

**Prevention**:
- Protected family time on calendar (non-negotiable)
- Weekly one-on-one with each family member
- Track: "When did I last have undivided time with each family member?"
- Quality over quantity: 15 minutes of full presence > 2 hours distracted

**Recovery prompt**: "Will I regret working or missing this moment? What's the cost of this work choice to the people I'm providing for?"

---

### Failure Mode 3: Financial Fear Paralysis

**Signs**:
- Hoarding money instead of using it for family experiences
- Risk aversion preventing career growth
- Anxiety about money despite adequate runway
- Inability to enjoy present due to future worry
- Teaching scarcity mindset to children

**Root cause**: Security pursuit became fear management. Lost sight that runway creates freedom, not just safety.

**Prevention**:
- Track "Months of Runway" as concrete metric (target: 24+)
- Distinguish security needs from anxiety-driven accumulation
- Schedule money for experiences, not just savings
- Model healthy relationship with money for {{child_name}}

**Recovery prompt**: "Am I protecting my family or imprisoning them with my fear? What would I do differently with 36 months of runway?"

---

### Failure Mode 4: Values Transmission Failure

**Signs**:
- Money conversations are taboo or tense
- Children have no idea how family finances work
- Work ethic invisible—kids only see outcomes, not effort
- Wealth without wisdom—inheritors without skills
- Financial literacy not taught age-appropriately

**Root cause**: Providing money without providing education. Confusing protection with secrecy.

**Prevention**:
- Monthly money conversations with family
- Involve {{child_name}} in age-appropriate financial decisions
- Make work ethic visible—don't hide the effort
- Matching strategy: match savings for major purchases

**Recovery prompt**: "What have I taught {{child_name}} about money this month? Would he know how to manage $10,000 if he received it tomorrow?"

---

## Father Role

The Father role with {{child_name}} (15, turning 16 in 2026) is in a critical developmental window. These years are non-renewable.

### Failure Mode 1: Lecture Over Listen

**Signs**:
- More talking than asking
- Teaching when presence is needed
- Missing bids for connection
- Conversations feel like monologues
- {{child_name}} stops sharing because he knows a lecture is coming

**Root cause**: Need to "add value" instead of just being present. INTJ tendency to optimize and fix.

**Prevention**:
- 5:1 listening-to-talking ratio goal
- Ask questions before offering solutions
- Side-by-side activities (car rides, walks) lower conversation resistance
- Practice: "Do you want me to listen or help solve?"

**Recovery prompt**: "Did you listen more than you lectured? What did {{child_name}} share that you didn't try to fix?"

---

### Failure Mode 2: Work Encroachment on {{child_name}} Time

**Signs**:
- Checking phone during {{child_name}} time
- Canceling plans for "urgent" work
- "Just this once" becoming pattern
- {{child_name}} time scheduled but not protected
- Work emergencies always win priority conflicts

**Root cause**: Work urgency feels immediate; family importance is abstract. Failure to protect calendar commitments.

**Prevention**:
- Block weekly {{child_name}} time as non-negotiable recurring event
- Phone off or away during scheduled time
- Ask before accepting work: "Does this protect or threaten my {{child_name}} time?"
- Track: How many times did work win over {{child_name}} time this month?

**Recovery prompt**: "Is this work priority actually more important than your son's critical teenage years? What would {{child_name}} say about this trade-off?"

---

### Failure Mode 3: Missing the Developmental Window

**Signs**:
- Treating college prep as "later" problem
- Not adapting approach as {{child_name}} matures
- Missing opportunities for deeper conversations
- Assuming you have more time than you do
- {{child_name}} becoming more independent without your influence

**Root cause**: Denial that window is finite. The 15-18 window closes faster than expected.

**Prevention**:
- Remember: Research shows father-son closeness carries outsized protective power precisely because it's less common
- Plan milestones: PSAT (junior year), college visits, rite of passage (16th birthday)
- Monthly check: "How is my relationship with {{child_name}} evolving?"
- Seek opportunities for meaning, not just activity

**Recovery prompt**: "{{child_name}} is 15 and will leave for college in 3 years. What would you do differently if he were leaving next month?"

---

### Failure Mode 4: Executive Function Support Failures (ADHD-Specific)

**Signs**:
- Judging {{child_name}} by neurotypical standards
- Frustration when "motivation" seems low
- Creating shame instead of scaffolding
- Enabling vs. supporting confusion
- Missing that EF development lags by ~30%

**Root cause**: Not calibrating expectations to developmental reality. At 15, {{child_name}}'s EF may align with 10-11 year old.

**Prevention**:
- Frame challenges with ADHD motivators: novelty, urgency, interest, competition, enjoyment
- Break tasks into collaborative checklists (2-3 steps at a time)
- Celebrate process, not just outcomes
- Consider external support (tutor, coach) to reduce parent-child tension
- Help him understand his own learning profile

**Recovery prompt**: "Am I supporting his executive function or expecting him to have capacities he hasn't yet developed? What would a developmental 30% lag mean for my expectations?"

---

### Failure Mode 5: Volatility and Unpredictability

**Signs**:
- Emotional reactions vary wildly
- Consequences not consistently enforced
- Promises made but not kept
- {{child_name}} doesn't know what to expect
- Trust eroding through unpredictability

**Root cause**: State management failures. Inconsistency undermines trust regardless of good intentions.

**Prevention**:
- State check before interactions: "Am I regulated enough for this?"
- Follow through on stated consequences even when inconvenient
- Be a promise keeper, not a promise maker
- Same rules and expectations over time

**Recovery prompt**: "Does {{child_name}} know what to expect from me? When did I last break a commitment to him?"

---

## Partner Role

The Partner role with {{partner_name}} involves both life partnership AND business partnership (EMC), requiring careful context separation.

### Failure Mode 1: Turning Away from Bids

**Signs**:
- Ignoring or dismissing attempts to connect
- Phone more engaging than partner
- Responding minimally to conversation starters
- Missing small moments of reaching out
- "Uh-huh" without actual attention

**Root cause**: Bids are often mundane—"Look at that," "Did you hear?"—and easy to miss. Connection erodes invisibly through accumulated small rejections.

**Prevention**:
- Track daily: "Did I turn toward or away from {{partner_name}}'s bids today?"
- Put phone down when partner speaks
- Notice and respond to first bids of the day
- Recognize: Couples who turn toward 86% of the time stay married; 33% divorced

**Recovery prompt**: "Did I turn toward {{partner_name}}'s bids for connection today, or was I too absorbed in my own world?"

---

### Failure Mode 2: Four Horsemen Appearance

**Signs**:

| Horseman | How It Shows Up |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Criticism** | "You always..." / "You never..." — attacking character, not behavior |
| **Contempt** | Eye-rolling, mockery, superiority, disdain |
| **Defensiveness** | "Yes, but..." / refusing to own your part |
| **Stonewalling** | Shutting down, withdrawing, refusing to engage |

**Root cause**: These patterns predict divorce with 94% accuracy. Contempt is the single biggest predictor—built on moral superiority.

**Prevention**:
- Criticism → Gentle start-up: Lead with "I feel..." not "You always..."
- Contempt → Build culture of appreciation: Daily appreciation, 5:1 ratio
- Defensiveness → Take responsibility: Own your 5%, avoid "Yes, but..."
- Stonewalling → Self-soothe: "I need 20 minutes to calm down"

**Recovery prompt**: "Did any of the Four Horsemen show up in my communication today? If so, what antidote should I apply?"

---

### Failure Mode 3: EMC Business Bleeding into Relationship

**Signs**:
- Business discussions dominate personal time
- Conflict about business decisions spills into relationship
- No clear boundaries between partner mode and business mode
- Relationship quality correlates with business stress
- Date nights become work meetings

**Root cause**: {{partner_name}} is both life partner AND business partner. Without intentional separation, one context contaminates the other.

**Prevention**:
- Separate State of Union (relationship) from EMC business meetings
- Define clear times/spaces for business vs. personal
- Ask before conversations: "Is this work or relationship?"
- Protect time that is explicitly non-EMC

**Recovery prompt**: "Are EMC conversations dominating our personal time? When did we last have a conversation that wasn't about business?"

---

### Failure Mode 4: Taking Partner for Granted

**Signs**:
- Assuming appreciation is understood without expressing it
- Relationship maintenance deprioritized
- Grand gestures rare; small deposits nonexistent
- Partner's goals/stressors unknown or unasked
- Confidence that stability means neglect is safe

**Root cause**: Relationship feels stable, so investment seems unnecessary. "Positive sentiment override" works until it doesn't.

**Prevention**:
- Weekly State of Union: 5 appreciations each, structured check-in
- Update Love Map: Know her dreams, fears, stressors, current world
- Small moments > grand gestures: 6-second kiss daily
- Track: Did I express specific appreciation this week?

**Recovery prompt**: "What are {{partner_name}}'s top 3 stressors right now? What is she excited about? If you don't know, you've been taking her for granted."

---

### Failure Mode 5: Repair Attempt Failures

**Signs**:
- Conflicts escalate without de-escalation attempts
- Pride prevents saying "Let's start over"
- Partner's repair attempts rejected
- Going to bed angry becomes normal
- Issues accumulate without resolution

**Root cause**: Repair attempts predict success more than conflict style. The skill is stopping escalation, not avoiding conflict.

**Prevention**:
- Memorize repair phrases: "Let's start over," "Can we pause?," "I'm sorry for my part"
- Accept partner's repair attempts—choose to step back from the fight
- Repair within 3 hours strengthens instead of erodes
- Post-conflict: Use aftermath process to complete repair

**Recovery prompt**: "Did I make or accept a repair attempt during our last conflict? Or did I let it escalate?"

---

### Failure Mode 6: INTJ Communication Coldness

**Signs**:
- Efficient but distant communication
- Solving when listening is needed
- Emotions dismissed as illogical
- Bluntness without warmth buffer
- Partner feels like a problem to solve, not a person to connect with

**Root cause**: INTJ natural style is efficient and solution-oriented. Without intentional warmth, efficiency reads as coldness.

**Prevention**:
- Ask: "Could this land warmer without losing clarity?"
- Practice: "I love you, and..." before difficult feedback
- Check: "Do you want me to listen or help solve?"
- Soften delivery without losing honesty

**Recovery prompt**: "Did I show up with both strength AND warmth, or just efficiency? How would {{partner_name}} describe my communication today?"

---

## Self Role

The Self role encompasses health, energy, renewal, learning, and professional fulfillment.

### Failure Mode 1: Neglecting Health for Productivity

**Signs**:
- Sleep < 7 hours regularly
- Exercise skipped for work
- Eating poorly for "efficiency"
- Physical symptoms ignored
- "I'll rest when this project is done" as chronic pattern

**Root cause**: Treating body as obstacle to productivity rather than foundation of it. Short-term output > long-term capacity.

**Prevention**:
- Sleep is commandment #1—non-negotiable 7-8 hours
- Exercise gives energy, doesn't take it
- Track energy levels alongside task completion
- Ask: "Am I optimizing for today or for a decade?"

**Recovery prompt**: "You're showing physical energy at 4/10 for the third day. When will you actually rest? Is this sustainable or are you setting up for a crash?"

---

### Failure Mode 2: All Work, No Recovery (Strategic Oscillation Failure)

**Signs**:
- No breaks between work blocks
- 90-minute sprints become 4-hour slogs
- Recovery viewed as laziness
- Weekends bleed into work
- Burnout warning signs present

**Root cause**: Misunderstanding that sustainable performance requires oscillation. Pushing through fatigue triggers stress response—reduced cognition, declining motivation.

**Prevention**:
- Work in 90-minute sprints + 15-20 minute real breaks
- Maximum 2-3 deep work cycles per day
- Daily, weekly, monthly, annual recovery rhythms
- Track: "Did I take adequate recovery this week?"

**Recovery prompt**: "You skipped recovery breaks all week. Is this the strategy that leads to peak performance, or the one that leads to burnout?"

---

### Failure Mode 3: Grip Stress Spiral (INTJ-Specific)

**Signs**:
- Impulsive behavior (binge eating, doom-scrolling, impulsive purchases)
- Scattered thinking, can't focus
- Obsessing over small details
- Feeling "not myself"
- Seeking physical sensation without intentionality

**Root cause**: Inferior Se function hijacking under stress. Ni exhaustion leads to unhealthy sensory seeking.

**Prevention**:
- Recognize warning signs early
- Response: Solitude, silence, gentle sensory activity
- Healthy Se: Cooking, walking in nature, creating something physical
- Protect 2+ hours daily solitude for Ni recovery

**Recovery prompt**: "Is this grip stress? When did you last have true solitude? What do you actually need right now?"

---

### Failure Mode 4: Rest as Guilt (Not Strategy)

**Signs**:
- Feeling guilty during downtime
- Unable to enjoy relaxation
- Rest feels like falling behind
- Renewal time invaded by work thoughts
- "Should be doing something productive" loops

**Root cause**: Identity wrapped in productivity. Rest feels like laziness rather than strategic investment.

**Prevention**:
- Reframe: Rest IS success for sustained performance
- Schedule rest like important meetings
- Treat downtime as success metric, not weakness
- Ask: "Is strategic renewal a sign of discipline, not laziness?"

**Recovery prompt**: "You treat rest as laziness. Rest is essential for sustained performance. Rest IS success. When did you last rest without guilt?"

---

### Failure Mode 5: Unfulfilling Work Drain

**Signs**:
- Dreading work repeatedly
- Going through motions without engagement
- Feeling disconnected from why work matters
- Envying others who love what they do
- Work depletes rather than energizes

**Root cause**: Following obligation instead of interest. Unfulfilling work drains energy; drained energy harms family.

**Prevention**:
- Follow interests into income—don't separate passion from profession
- Say no to emptiness—decline work that doesn't engage, even if it pays
- Track not just hours but engagement level
- Ask: "Would I be proud for {{child_name}} to see me doing this work?"

**Recovery prompt**: "Did you feel energized or drained by today's work? Is this work you'd choose even without pay? What would need to change?"

---

## Professional/Work Role

The Professional role spans {{company_1_name}}, {{company_2_name}}, and EMC. Work is an expression of character.

### Failure Mode 1: Busy vs. Productive

**Signs**:
- Full calendar but unclear output
- Activity confusion with progress
- Working hard but not on right things
- "I'm so busy" as identity statement
- Days pass without meaningful advancement

**Root cause**: Measuring effort instead of impact. Busyness feels productive but may be avoidance of important work.

**Prevention**:
- Ask before each task: "Why does this matter? Really?"
- Track outcomes, not just activities
- Weekly: "What actually moved the needle?"
- Distinguish A-priority (must complete) from busywork

**Recovery prompt**: "Are you being productive or just busy? What would happen if you did half the tasks but doubled the impact?"

---

### Failure Mode 2: Urgent Over Important

**Signs**:
- Reactive mode as default
- Important projects chronically delayed
- Other people's priorities drive your day
- Strategic work always "tomorrow"
- Fire-fighting feels heroic but prevents progress

**Root cause**: Urgent feels important; important rarely feels urgent. Without protection, urgent always wins.

**Prevention**:
- Protect deep work blocks for important (not urgent) work
- Ask: "Is this actually urgent or does it just feel that way?"
- Weekly review: "What important thing did I neglect this week?"
- Say no to false urgencies

**Recovery prompt**: "What important work have you been postponing for urgent distractions? What's the cost of another week of this pattern?"

---

### Failure Mode 3: Context Switching Chaos

**Signs**:
- {{company_1_name}}, 144, EMC competing for attention simultaneously
- No clear boundaries between contexts
- Mental overhead from constant switching
- Deep work impossible due to fragmentation
- Each venture gets distracted partial attention

**Root cause**: Multiple ventures without context separation. Mental switching cost compounds.

**Prevention**:
- Use context-switch skill to deliberately transition
- Time-block by company, not by task type
- Seasonal focus: One venture primary, others maintenance
- Clear entry/exit rituals for each context

**Recovery prompt**: "How many context switches happened today? Did any venture get your deep, undivided attention?"

---

### Failure Mode 4: Over-Commitment

**Signs**:
- Saying yes to feel helpful
- Commitments exceed capacity
- Constant behind-feeling
- Quality suffering across all work
- No margin for unexpected demands

**Root cause**: Difficulty saying no. Desire to please or prove worth through taking on more.

**Prevention**:
- Before yes: "If I had a blank slate, would I add this?"
- Track commitments vs. capacity explicitly
- Default to no; change to yes only with clear justification
- Ask: "What am I implicitly saying no to by saying yes here?"

**Recovery prompt**: "You're saying yes to everything. What are you really saying no to? Your health? Your family? Your best work?"

---

## Cross-Role Failure Patterns

These failure modes operate across multiple roles simultaneously.

### The Over-Optimization Trap

**Signs**:
- One role optimized at expense of others
- "Just this season" becomes permanent
- Other roles in maintenance mode indefinitely
- Role neglect rationalized as temporary
- Family/self roles consistently deprioritized

**Root cause**: Success in one area creates momentum that crowds out others. Optimization feels productive but is actually imbalanced.

**Prevention**:
- Weekly role check-in: Which roles got attention? Which neglected?
- Track role distribution, not just productivity
- Ask: "Am I optimizing one role at the expense of my life?"
- Remember: Role priority for emergencies (Son > Wife > Work) but default is balance

**Recovery prompt**: "You said family matters most. Your weekly review shows zero quality time with {{partner_name}} this week. Which is true—the words or the actions?"

---

### Seasonal Blindness

**Signs**:
- Not adjusting role priorities for life seasons
- Same approach regardless of context changes
- Missing that some seasons require different allocation
- Fighting seasonal demands instead of flowing with them
- Guilt about seasonal trade-offs

**Root cause**: Expecting permanent balance instead of seasonal prioritization. Life has phases; role weight should shift accordingly.

**Prevention**:
- Define current season explicitly: What's the theme? What's the exit condition?
- Identify seasonal priorities (top 3-4) and explicit deprioritizations
- Review monthly: "Am I still in this season?"
- Make trade-offs intentional, not unconscious

**Recovery prompt**: "What season of life are you in right now? What role deserves primary focus? What's explicitly deprioritized? Is this intentional or default?"

---

### The Slow Drift

**Signs**:
- Gradual deviation without noticing
- Values and actions slowly diverging
- Small compromises accumulating
- Wake up far from where you intended
- "How did I get here?" realization

**Root cause**: No regular check-ins against failure modes. Drift happens in small increments that feel harmless individually.

**Prevention**:
- Weekly scan of failure modes
- Monthly proximity ratings (1-10)
- Quarterly deep assessment
- Ask: "If I continue exactly as I am, where do I end up in 5 years?"

**Recovery prompt**: "Are you drifting toward any failure modes you committed to avoid? What's one small course correction you can make today?"

---

### The Comparison Trap

**Signs**:
- Success defined by others' standards
- Social media comparison affecting self-worth
- Imposter syndrome despite achievements
- Never enough despite progress
- Others' paths seeming more valid

**Root cause**: External validation replacing internal foundation. Success definition borrowed instead of owned.

**Prevention**:
- Return to foundation.md: Your definition of success
- Track progress against YOUR goals, not others'
- Curate inputs—reduce comparison sources
- Ask: "By MY definition of success, am I making progress?"

**Recovery prompt**: "Whose definition of success are you measuring against? What would change if you only measured against your own foundation?"

---

## Weekly Role Check Questions

Use these during weekly review for quick role health assessment.

| Role | Quick Check Question | Warning Sign |
|------|---------------------|--------------|
| Provider | "Did my work serve love this week?" | Work felt disconnected from family purpose |
| Father | "Did {{child_name}} feel my presence and acceptance?" | Can't recall quality one-on-one time |
| Partner | "Did I turn toward {{partner_name}}'s bids?" | More turning away than toward |
| Self | "Did I protect renewal?" | Energy depleted, no recovery taken |
| Professional | "Did I work on what matters most?" | Busy but not impactful |
| Cross-Role | "Am I drifting toward any failure mode?" | Proximity rating > 6 on any item |
