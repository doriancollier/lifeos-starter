# Learning Log

This file tracks what LifeOS has learned through `/system:learn` sessions. Each entry captures:
- What was learned
- How it was codified
- When it was learned

## Recent Learnings

<!-- New entries are added here automatically by /system:learn -->

## Learning Index

| Date | Topic | Component Created | Status |

## How This Works

When you run `/system:learn [topic]`, the system:
1. Experiments to discover working approaches
2. Codifies successful behaviors into skills, commands, or hooks
3. Logs the learning here for future reference

This log helps you:
- Track what capabilities have been added
- Recall why certain behaviors exist
- Build on previous learnings
