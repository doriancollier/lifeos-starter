# Review Sessions Directory

This directory stores session data for `/system:review` command.

Each review session creates a subdirectory:
```
.claude/review-sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-[scope]/
├── config.json           # Session metadata, resumption support
├── inventory.md          # Files to review
├── findings/             # Agent outputs (one per area)
├── cross-references/     # Cross-ref validation results
├── synthesis/            # Combined findings, recommendations
└── fixes/               # Applied changes log
```

Session directories are created during Medium/Large reviews for:
- Progress tracking across multiple agents
- Resumption support if review is interrupted
- Audit trail of what was reviewed and fixed
