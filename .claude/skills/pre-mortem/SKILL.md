# Pre-Mortem Skill

Guides structured failure analysis using prospective hindsight to identify risks and develop mitigation strategies.

## When to Activate

- Before A-priority projects
- Before major financial decisions or investments
- Before career changes or strategic pivots
- Before life decisions (relationship, family, relocation)
- When overconfidence is apparent
- When an opportunity looks "too good to be true"
- During quarterly planning for major initiatives
- When user says "What could go wrong?"

## Core Concept: Prospective Hindsight

Research shows that imagining an event has **already occurred** (rather than might occur) increases accuracy in identifying reasons by 30%.

**The Shift**:
- From: "What might go wrong?"
- To: "It is [date]. This failed spectacularly. What happened?"

This framing creates psychological safety for surfacing concerns and reduces overconfidence bias.

## The Pre-Mortem Process

### Step 1: Setup
- State the decision clearly
- Set future date (6-12 months out for projects, 2-5 years for life decisions)

### Step 2: Time Travel
> "It is [date]. This has failed spectacularly. You deeply regret this choice."

### Step 3: Generate Failure Reasons
- Aim for 10-15 specific ways it could fail
- Include uncomfortable possibilities
- Ask: "What are you avoiding thinking about?"
- Push past obvious answers to hidden concerns

### Step 4: Categorize - Tigers, Paper Tigers, Elephants

| Category | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Tiger** | Clear threat that will hurt if unaddressed | Mitigation plan immediately |
| **Paper Tiger** | Apparent threat you're not worried about | Acknowledge and monitor |
| **Elephant** | What you're avoiding discussing | Surface and address FIRST |

**Critical Insight**: Elephants are often the actual causes of failure. The things we avoid discussing are frequently the most dangerous.

### Step 5: Mitigate Tigers
For each Tiger, define:
- Preventive action
- Owner
- Deadline
- Success metric
- Early warning signs

### Step 6: Decide
- [ ] Proceed as planned
- [ ] Proceed with modifications: [list]
- [ ] Delay until: [condition]
- [ ] Abandon

## Double-Barreled Pre-Mortem (For Life Decisions)

Run TWO scenarios to avoid analysis paralysis:

**Scenario 1 - Failure**:
"I did this and it failed. What went wrong?"

**Scenario 2 - Regret**:
"I didn't do this and I regret it in 5 years. What did I miss?"

Both action and inaction carry risks - analyze both directions.

## Risk Mitigation Categories

Convert insights into preventive actions across five categories:

1. **Process Improvements** - Workflows, communication protocols
2. **Contingency Plans** - Backups, buffers, redundancy
3. **Skill Development** - Training, hiring, consultation
4. **Technology Upgrades** - Tools, systems, automation
5. **Communication Strategies** - Reporting, escalation, feedback loops

Each Tiger needs at least one mitigation type with specific owner, deadline, and success metric.

## Key Questions/Prompts

### For Running Pre-Mortems

**Opening Frame**:
- "Imagine it is [X months/years] from now. This has failed spectacularly. What went wrong?"

**Risk Discovery**:
- "What's the most likely reason this fails?"
- "What's the most threatening reason (low probability, catastrophic impact)?"
- "What key assumptions have we made? What if they're wrong?"
- "What external factors could blindside us?"
- "What could we do to cause our own failure?"
- "What are we not talking about?" (Elephants)

**Mitigation Development**:
- "For each Tiger: What single action most reduces this risk?"
- "What early warning signs indicate this risk is materializing?"
- "What's our contingency if this happens anyway?"
- "Who owns preventing this? By when?"

**Decision Quality**:
- "Is this confidence or overconfidence?"
- "What would change our mind about this plan?"
- "Have we considered both action AND inaction risks?"

## Integration Points

### With Daily Planning
- Review open pre-mortem mitigation actions
- Check early warning indicators for active decisions
- Add mitigation tasks to today's work plan

### With Weekly Review
- Review all active pre-mortem commitments
- Check status of mitigation actions
- Reassess risk levels based on new information
- Celebrate successful risk prevention
- Surface new Elephants from the week

### With Board of Advisors
- Include pre-mortem in briefing document for major decisions
- Ask advisors to identify blind spots (Elephants)
- Request validation of risk prioritization
- Seek perspective on Tigers vs Paper Tigers

### With Goal Tracking
- Conduct pre-mortem at goal setting time
- Identify failure modes specific to that goal
- Build mitigation into goal execution plan
- Track risk indicators alongside progress metrics

### With Project Creation
- Trigger pre-mortem for all A-priority projects
- Include pre-mortem document in project folder
- Link mitigation actions to project tasks
- Schedule post-mortem to compare predictions vs reality

## Coaching Triggers

- When A-priority project is created: "Have you done a pre-mortem on this?"
- When major decision surfaces: "What would your future self regret about this?"
- When overconfidence is apparent: "Is this confidence or overconfidence?"
- When risk discussion is avoided: "What are you not thinking about? What's the elephant?"
- When committing resources: "What's the cost if this fails? Have we prepared?"
- Before strategic pivots: "Let's run a pre-mortem - imagine this failed in 2 years. Why?"

## Time Limits

To prevent analysis paralysis:
- Individual decisions: 30-45 minutes
- Team projects: 60 minutes
- Life decisions: 90 minutes

At the end, require a Go/No-Go decision. Pre-mortems that don't end in decisions become procrastination disguised as planning.

## Connection to Stoic Practice

Pre-mortems are the modern, structured application of premeditatio malorum (premeditation of evils):

> "We suffer more often in imagination than in reality." - Seneca

Neither practice desires adversity; both build mental models for handling it. The goal is proactive preparation, not catastrophizing.

Monthly reflection prompt: "What am I not thinking about that could hurt me?"
