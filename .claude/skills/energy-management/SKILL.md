# Energy Management Skill

Guides energy optimization across four dimensions for sustainable performance and burnout prevention.

## When to Activate

- During morning planning (`/daily:plan`)
- When user reports feeling tired, overwhelmed, or burned out
- When productivity drops without clear cause
- During weekly review energy assessment
- When planning high-intensity work periods
- When user skips recovery or pushes through fatigue
- When grip stress indicators appear (INTJ-specific: impulsive behavior)

## Core Concept: Energy Over Time

You cannot create more hours, but you can optimize energy quality and capacity. Neglecting any energy dimension diminishes overall capacity, like "an engine sputtering when one of its cylinders misfires."

**The Four Dimensions**:

| Dimension | Focus | Foundation For |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Physical** | Body, sleep, nutrition, exercise | Everything else |
| **Emotional** | Relationships, feelings, stress | Engagement quality |
| **Mental** | Focus, clarity, cognitive load | Decision quality |
| **Spiritual** | Purpose, meaning, alignment | The "why" for everything |

Physical energy is the foundation. Spiritual energy (purpose/meaning) provides the "why" that fuels all other dimensions.

## Energy Assessment

Rate each dimension 1-10 in morning planning:

```markdown
## Energy Assessment
- Physical: _/10
- Emotional: _/10
- Mental: _/10
- Spiritual: _/10

Energy allocation plan:
- High-energy window: [time] -> [high-value work]
- Recovery needed: [yes/no] -> [action]
```

### Interpretation Guide

| Score | State | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 8-10 | Thriving | Deploy on high-value, strategic work |
| 5-7 | Adequate | Normal execution, protect from drains |
| 3-4 | Depleted | Reduce demands, prioritize recovery |
| 1-2 | Critical | Stop. Recovery is the only priority |

## The Oscillation Principle

Sustainable high performance requires alternating between full engagement and complete disengagement, mirroring athletic training patterns.

**Why It Works**:
- Pushing through fatigue triggers "Ultradian Stress Response" (cortisol, poor cognition, declining motivation)
- Without recovery, stress leads to burnout
- With strategic recovery, stress leads to growth

**The 90-Minute Sprint Structure**:
- Work in 90-minute focused blocks (ultradian rhythm)
- Take 15-20 minute recovery breaks (no screens - walk, stretch, hydrate)
- Maximum 2-3 deep work cycles per day
- Research shows 40% higher productivity when aligning with these rhythms

**Recovery Rhythms to Build**:

| Timeframe | Recovery Practice |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Daily | 90-min work cycles with breaks, evening wind-down |
| Weekly | Full day off, nature time |
| Monthly | Half-day retreat or reset |
| Quarterly | 1-2 day planning retreat |
| Annually | Extended vacation (1+ weeks) |

## Recovery Strategies by Dimension

### Physical Recovery
- Sleep 7-8 hours (non-negotiable foundation)
- Exercise 3-5x per week
- Hydration and nutrition
- Movement breaks every 90 minutes
- Watch for: fatigue, illness, tension

### Emotional Recovery
- Quality time with {{partner_name}} and {{child_name}}
- Social connection (not work-related)
- Activities that bring joy
- Processing difficult emotions (journaling, conversation)
- Watch for: irritability, withdrawal, cynicism

### Mental Recovery
- No-screen time
- Nature exposure
- Mindless activities (walking, showering)
- Sleep (processes cognitive load)
- Watch for: decision fatigue, inability to focus, procrastination

### Spiritual Recovery
- Review mission/vision/foundation
- Activities aligned with values
- Service to others
- Reflection and gratitude
- Watch for: meaninglessness, disconnection, "going through motions"

## Burnout Prevention Checklist

### The Three Rs
- [ ] **Respite**: Did I take regular breaks from work this week?
- [ ] **Regimen**: Did I maintain sleep schedule and exercise routine?
- [ ] **Disengagement**: Did I practice structured work-off time?

### Warning Signs (check if present)
- [ ] Declining creativity/productivity
- [ ] Impaired decision-making
- [ ] Damaged relationships
- [ ] Physical symptoms (fatigue, illness)
- [ ] Reduced risk tolerance
- [ ] Chronic low energy (3+ days)
- [ ] Grip stress (INTJ-specific: impulsive behavior, physical neglect)

### Recovery Actions
If 2+ warning signs present:
1. Cancel non-essential commitments
2. Add buffer to schedule
3. Prioritize sleep above all else
4. Surface this in weekly review
5. Consider Board of Advisors consultation

## Key Questions/Prompts

### Daily Planning
- "What's my energy stock right now? (Physical/Emotional/Mental/Spiritual)"
- "Am I matching high-energy periods to high-value work?"
- "What recovery do I need today?"

### When Energy Flags
- "You're showing physical energy at 4/10 for the third day. When will you actually rest?"
- "You skipped recovery breaks all week. Is this sustainable or are you setting up for a crash?"
- "Is this strategic renewal or avoidance?"

### For Pattern Recognition
- "What energized me this week? What depleted me?"
- "Where is my energy level on a 1-10 scale?"
- "What one shift would restore balance?"

### INTJ-Specific
- "Did you experience grip stress (impulsive behavior)? What triggered it?"
- "Solitude time needed? How much?"
- "Is this grip stress telling me I need solitude?"

## Integration Points

### With Daily Note
Add to morning planning:
1. Energy Check (4 dimensions, 1-10 scale)
2. High-energy window identification
3. Recovery scheduling

Add to evening reflection:
1. Energy patterns observed
2. What worked, what drained
3. Tomorrow's energy priorities

### With Weekly Review
- Rate weekly energy average
- List drains and deposits
- Track burnout warning signs
- Adjustment for next week
- Celebrate recovery wins

### With Task Prioritization
- Schedule A-priorities during peak energy
- Match task type to energy state:
  - High energy: Strategic thinking, creative work, difficult conversations
  - Medium energy: Execution, routine tasks, meetings
  - Low energy: Admin, email, easy tasks (or recovery)

### With Calendar
- Block deep work during peak energy windows
- Build buffer time between meetings
- Protect evening wind-down
- Schedule breaks explicitly

## Coaching Triggers

- When user plans back-to-back meetings: "Where's your buffer for recovery?"
- When energy scores drop 3+ days: "Your energy has been depleted for three days. When will you actually rest?"
- When user pushes through fatigue: "You skipped recovery breaks. Is this sustainable?"
- When user reports burnout signs: "What's draining you? What would restore you?"
- Before intensive periods: "How are you building recovery into this sprint?"
- When impulsive behavior noted: "Is this grip stress? Do you need solitude?"

## Energy vs Time Management

| Time Management Says | Energy Management Says |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Fill all available hours | Protect peak hours for peak work |
| More hours = more output | More energy = better output |
| Work until done | Work in focused sprints |
| Rest when exhausted | Schedule recovery before exhaustion |
| All hours equal | Match work type to energy state |

**The Shift**: From "How much can I fit in?" to "How can I bring my best energy to what matters most?"
