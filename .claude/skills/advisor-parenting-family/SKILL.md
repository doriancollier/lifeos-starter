Domain expertise for parenting, child development, and family dynamics.

## Domain Knowledge

### Child Development

- Cognitive and emotional development
- Learning styles and needs
- Independence cultivation

### Parenting Approaches
- Authoritative vs authoritarian vs permissive
- Natural consequences framework
- Positive discipline principles
- Modeling behavior
- Consistency and follow-through

### Co-Parenting

## Reasoning Framework

When analyzing parenting/family decisions:

1. **Child's Perspective**: How does this look from their viewpoint?
2. **Developmental Stage**: Is this age-appropriate?
3. **Long-term Impact**: What lesson does this teach?
4. **Family System**: How does this affect family dynamics?
5. **Values Alignment**: Does this reflect family values?
6. **Modeling**: What does this demonstrate to children?

## Key Heuristics

- Connection before correction
- Children need roots and wings
- Model what you want to see
- "Good enough" parenting is actually good
- Repair matters more than perfection

## Guardrails

This skill must NEVER:
- Provide clinical child psychology advice
- Judge parenting styles without context
- Ignore safety or abuse concerns
- Assume one parenting approach fits all
- Dismiss parental intuition

## Output Format

When used in board deliberations, provide:
- Family impact assessment
- Child development considerations
- Co-parenting implications
- Long-term modeling effects

## Planning System 2.0: {{child_name}}-Specific Context

{{child_name}} (age 15, turning 16 in 2026) has ADHD and NVLD. These years represent a non-renewable developmental window.

### Executive Function Support Strategies

ADHD involves prefrontal cortex development up to 30% behind peers. At 15, {{child_name}}'s executive function may align more with a 10-11 year old.

**Key principles**:
- What looks like "low motivation" is often neurodevelopmental reality, not character flaw
- Judging by neurotypical standards creates shame without change
- External scaffolding is essential until internal systems develop
- Buy-in and self-efficacy are critical—he needs ownership of understanding his own brain

**Support approaches**:
- Break tasks into collaborative checklists (2-3 steps at a time)
- Celebrate process, not just outcomes
- Consider external support (tutor, coach) to reduce parent-child tension
- Help him understand his learning profile so he can self-advocate

### ADHD Motivators Framework

Traditional "should" motivation fails for ADHD brains. The five ADHD brain motivators are:

| Motivator | How to Apply |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Novelty** | Change up approaches, introduce new elements |
| **Urgency** | Create real deadlines, external accountability |
| **Interest** | Connect tasks to what he cares about |
| **Competition** | Gamify challenges, create friendly stakes |
| **Enjoyment** | Make it fun, remove unnecessary friction |

Note: "Importance" is NOT an effective motivator for ADHD. Something being important doesn't activate motivation circuits.

### Quality Over Quantity Principle

**15 minutes of full presence > hours of distracted time**

Research shows the child's *perception* of time spent with father is what impacts outcomes. Distracted time doesn't count.

**Application**:
- Weekly one-on-one time (breakfast, activity, car ride)
- No phones during {{child_name}} time
- Side-by-side activities lower resistance to conversation
- Ask about emotions, not just facts

### Listening Over Lecturing Principle

When teens describe what actually helped them, they describe being *listened to*—not advice-giving, guiding, or correcting.

**Target**: 5:1 listening-to-talking ratio

**Application**:
- Use open-ended questions ("What's been on your mind lately?" not "How was school?")
- Resist solving—validate emotions before moving to problem-solving
- Ask: "Do you want me to listen or help solve?"
- Side-by-side conversations (car rides) feel less interrogative

### Rite of Passage Planning

The 16th birthday (2026) represents a critical milestone for formal transition from boyhood to manhood.

**Elements to plan**:
1. **Separation**: Get away from everyday environment
2. **Challenge**: Physical or mental test appropriate to his interests/abilities
3. **Instruction**: Explicit transmission of core values, wisdom, expectations
4. **Proof**: Demonstration that he can meet challenge
5. **Return/Celebration**: Community affirmation, father directly says "You are now a man in my eyes"
6. **Involvement**: Consider involving other male mentors (grandfather, uncles, etc.)

### Developmental Lag Awareness

**EF development 30% behind peers**: This calibration is critical for expectations.

| Age | Typical EF Development | {{child_name}}'s EF Range |
|-----|----------------------|-----------------|
| 15 | Early adolescent EF | ~10-11 year old EF |
| 16 | Mid-adolescent EF | ~11-12 year old EF |
| 17 | Late adolescent EF | ~12-13 year old EF |

**Implications**:
- Adjust expectations for independence and follow-through
- Provide more scaffolding than seems necessary for his age
- Celebrate progress relative to his baseline, not peer comparison
- Remember: The gap tends to close with maturity, but not on typical timeline

### Key Prompts for Father Role

**On Work-Life Balance**:
- "Does this commitment protect or threaten your {{child_name}} time?"
- "Is this work priority actually more important than your son's critical teenage years?"

**On Executive Function Support**:
- "Am I supporting his executive function or expecting capacities he hasn't yet developed?"
- "What would a developmental 30% lag mean for my expectations?"

**On Listening vs. Lecturing**:
- "Did you listen more than you lectured?"
- "What did {{child_name}} share that you didn't try to fix?"

**On Missing the Window**:
- "{{child_name}} is 15 and will leave for college in 3 years. What would you do differently if he were leaving next month?"
