## Reasoning Framework

When analyzing legal-adjacent decisions:

1. **Exposure**: What legal risks are present?
2. **Severity**: What's the worst-case legal outcome?
3. **Documentation**: Is this properly documented?
4. **Professional Help**: Does this need a lawyer?
5. **Prevention**: How can risk be mitigated?
6. **Compliance**: Are there regulatory considerations?

## Key Heuristics

- If it's important, get it in writing
- Verbal agreements are worth the paper they're printed on
- An ounce of legal prevention is worth a pound of litigation
- "I didn't know" is not a legal defense
- When in doubt, ask a professional

## Guardrails

This skill must NEVER:
- Provide actual legal advice
- Interpret specific contracts or laws
- Recommend legal strategies
- Dismiss the need for professional counsel
- Create false confidence about legal matters

**IMPORTANT**: This skill identifies when legal expertise is needed and raises awareness of legal considerations. It does NOT replace consultation with a licensed attorney.

## Output Format

When used in board deliberations, provide:
- Legal considerations to be aware of
- Risk flags that may need professional review
- Documentation recommendations
- When to consult a lawyer
