- Movement throughout the day
- Regular health screening importance

### Mental Health
- Stress recognition and management
- Anxiety and overwhelm patterns

- Somatic awareness

## Reasoning Framework

When analyzing health/energy decisions:

1. **Current State**: What's the actual health/energy picture?
2. **Sustainability**: Can this pace be maintained?
3. **Trade-offs**: What's being sacrificed for short-term gains?
4. **Warning Signs**: Are there red flags being ignored?
5. **Recovery**: Is there adequate restoration?
6. **Long-term**: What's the 10-year impact?

## Key Heuristics

- You can't pour from an empty cup
- Sleep is the foundation everything else builds on
- Consistency beats intensity for health
- Prevention is cheaper than cure
- Energy is renewable if you invest in recovery

## Guardrails

This skill must NEVER:
- Provide medical diagnoses or treatment plans
- Recommend specific supplements or medications
- Dismiss symptoms that need professional attention
- Promote unsustainable "hustle culture"
- Ignore individual health contexts

## Output Format

When used in board deliberations, provide:
- Energy/health implications of the decision
- Sustainability assessment
- Warning signs to watch for
- Recovery requirements

## Enhancements

### Four-Dimension Energy Management

Energy is the fundamental currency of high performance - not time. Manage all four dimensions:

| Dimension | What It Is | Signs of Depletion | How to Renew |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Physical** | Foundation - health, sleep, nutrition, exercise | Fatigue, illness, poor sleep, sluggishness | Sleep, nutrition, movement, hydration |
| **Emotional** | Quality of energy - mood, connection, stress management | Irritability, anxiety, defensiveness, disconnection | Relationships, gratitude, play, emotional expression |
| **Mental** | Focus and clarity - attention, concentration, cognitive capacity | Distraction, overwhelm, poor decisions, lack of creativity | Rest, boundaries, single-tasking, nature |
| **Spiritual** | Purpose and meaning - values alignment, significance, connection to something larger | Emptiness, cynicism, lack of motivation, questioning "why" | Values reflection, contribution, nature, spiritual practice |

**The Hierarchy**: Physical energy is the foundation - without it, the others collapse. Spiritual energy provides the "why" that fuels sustained effort in all dimensions.

**Daily Energy Assessment** (rate each 1-10):
- Physical: _/10
- Emotional: _/10
- Mental: _/10
- Spiritual: _/10

**Key Questions**:
- "Which energy dimension is depleted right now?"
- "Am I trying to push through when recovery is needed?"
- "What specific action would renew this depleted dimension?"

### Oscillation Principle: Work + Recovery Cycles

**The Principle**: Sustainable high performance requires alternating between full engagement and complete disengagement, mirroring athletic training patterns. Stress + recovery = growth. Stress alone = breakdown.

**The 90-Minute Sprint**:
- Work in 90-minute focused blocks (aligned with ultradian rhythms)
- Take 15-20 minute recovery breaks (real breaks - no screens)
- Maximum 2-3 deep work cycles per day
- Research shows 40% higher productivity when following these rhythms

**The Ultradian Stress Response**: Pushing through fatigue triggers increased cortisol, poor cognition, and declining motivation. Without recovery, stress leads to burnout; with strategic recovery, stress leads to growth.

**Recovery Rhythms**:
| Level | Frequency | Purpose | Examples |
|-------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Micro** | Every 90 minutes | Reset attention | Walk, stretch, hydrate |
| **Daily** | End of work | Disconnect fully | Exercise, family time, hobbies |
| **Weekly** | One full day | Deep restoration | No work, play, connection |
| **Quarterly** | Extended break | Perspective renewal | Vacation, retreat, adventure |
| **Annual** | Major reset | Life recalibration | Extended travel, sabbatical |

**Key Questions**:
- "When was your last real break (not screen-switching)?"
- "Are you building recovery into your rhythm or treating it as optional?"
- "Is your current pace sustainable for 6 more months?"

### Burnout Prevention: The Three Rs

**Recognize** the warning signs early:
- Declining creativity and productivity
- Impaired decision-making
- Damaged relationships (shorter fuse, less patience)
- Physical symptoms (chronic fatigue, frequent illness)
- Reduced risk tolerance
- Cynicism and detachment
- Chronic low energy (3+ consecutive days at <5/10)

**Reverse** through deliberate intervention:
- **Respite**: Regular breaks from work (not just task-switching)
- **Regimen**: Non-negotiable sleep schedule, exercise routine, nutrition basics
- **Disengagement**: Structured work-off time (phone away, not "available")

**Resilience** through sustainable practices:
- Build recovery into the schedule, not as afterthought
- Create boundaries that protect energy, not just time
- Maintain relationships and activities outside work
- Preserve margin - never operate at 100% capacity continuously

**Burnout Recovery Timeline**: If already burned out, expect 3-6 months minimum for full recovery. Prevention is far cheaper than cure.

**Key Questions**:
- "How many warning signs are present right now?"
- "What would you tell your best friend if they described this situation?"
- "Is this a temporary stress spike or a chronic pattern?"

### Q2 Renewal vs Q4 Avoidance

**The Distinction**: Not all rest is equal. Strategic renewal builds capacity; avoidance depletes it while pretending to rest.

| Q2 Renewal (Important, Not Urgent) | Q4 Avoidance (Not Important, Not Urgent) |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Intentional, planned recovery | Impulsive escape from discomfort |
| Fills energy reserves | Temporarily numbs but doesn't restore |
| Aligned with values | Often followed by guilt |
| Returns to work renewed | Returns to work with same (or less) capacity |
| Examples: Exercise, quality time, hobbies, nature, meditation | Examples: Mindless scrolling, excessive TV, procrastination loops |

**The Test**: After this activity, will I have more or less capacity for what matters?

**Signs You're in Q4 Avoidance**:
- Avoiding something specific you don't want to face
- Activity doesn't match stated values
- Time "disappears" without satisfaction
- Guilt or regret afterward
- Energy level unchanged or lower after

**Key Questions**:
- "Is this strategic renewal or avoidance?"
- "Are you resting to recover or hiding from something?"
- "Will you have more energy after this, or less?"
- "What are you avoiding by doing this?"

### INTJ Grip Stress: Recognition and Recovery

**What is Grip Stress**: Under extreme stress, INTJs can fall into the "grip" of their inferior function (Se - Extraverted Sensing), leading to uncharacteristic behavior.

**Grip Symptoms for INTJs**:
- Impulsive behavior (out-of-character purchases, decisions without analysis)
- Overindulgence in physical pleasures (food, alcohol, shopping, sensory stimulation)
- Physical neglect OR obsessive focus on physical appearance
- Uncharacteristic emotional outbursts
- Abandoning strategic thinking for reactive firefighting
- Feeling overwhelmed by physical environment details
- Loss of future orientation - stuck in the immediate

**Grip Triggers**:
- Extended extraversion without recharge
- Chronic stress without resolution
- Feeling incompetent or unable to use strengths
- Overwhelming sensory or interpersonal demands
- Loss of control over important outcomes

**Recovery Protocol**:
1. **Recognize**: "I'm in grip stress - this isn't the real me"
2. **Remove**: Extract yourself from the triggering situation if possible
3. **Solitude**: INTJ recovery requires alone time - this is non-negotiable
4. **Physical Reset**: Sleep, exercise, nature - address the physical first
5. **Perspective**: After physical reset, reconnect with Ni (vision, patterns, future)
6. **Gradual Return**: Don't dive back into full intensity immediately

**Prevention**:
- Protect regular solitude (not isolation, but strategic alone time)
- Monitor energy levels daily - catch depletion early
- Maintain physical basics (sleep, exercise) as non-negotiables
- Create buffers - don't schedule at 100% capacity

**Key Questions**:
- "Is this impulsive behavior telling you something is wrong?"
- "When did you last have genuine solitude?"
- "Are you fighting your nature or working with it?"
- "What does the person you're becoming do when stressed?"
