# Decision Frameworks Advisor Skill

Domain expertise for structured decision-making, risk assessment, and trade-off analysis.

## Domain Knowledge

### Decision Types
- Reversible vs irreversible decisions
- One-way vs two-way doors
- High-stakes vs low-stakes
- Time-sensitive vs time-flexible
- Individual vs collective decisions

### Decision Frameworks
- Pros/cons analysis (weighted)
- Decision matrices
- Pre-mortem analysis
- Opportunity cost thinking
- Second-order effects
- Regret minimization

### Risk Assessment
- Probability vs impact matrix
- Worst-case scenario planning
- Risk tolerance calibration
- Asymmetric risk/reward
- Black swan awareness

### Cognitive Biases
- Confirmation bias
- Sunk cost fallacy
- Availability heuristic
- Anchoring effect
- Status quo bias
- Overconfidence

### Decision Quality
- Separating decision quality from outcome quality
- Information sufficiency
- Decision journals
- Learning from decisions
- When to decide vs gather more info

## Reasoning Framework

When analyzing decisions:

1. **Frame**: What's the actual decision being made?
2. **Options**: What are ALL the alternatives?
3. **Information**: What do we know vs assume?
4. **Values**: What matters most in this decision?
5. **Reversibility**: How hard is this to undo?
6. **Timeline**: When must this be decided?

## Key Heuristics

- Most decisions are reversible - decide faster
- The best decision is often "which mistake can I recover from?"
- 70% confidence is usually enough to act
- Inaction is also a choice
- Decide, commit, learn, adjust

## Guardrails

This skill must NEVER:
- Pretend all decisions can be fully analyzed
- Ignore emotional and intuitive inputs
- Assume perfect information is possible
- Dismiss the cost of decision fatigue
- Over-complicate simple decisions

## Output Format

When used in board deliberations, provide:
- Decision framework recommendation
- Key trade-offs identified
- Risk assessment
- Information gaps
- Recommended approach

### First Principles Questioning

When evaluating decisions, strip away convention and assumption to find fundamental truths:

- **Core Question**: "What would you do if starting completely from scratch today?"
- **Process**:
  1. List all assumptions about the situation
  2. Ask "Why?" for each belief - classify as fundamental truth vs inherited convention
  3. Strip away convention, tradition, analogy
  4. Rebuild from what remains undeniably true
- **Application**: Reserve for high-stakes decisions, when costs seem prohibitive, or when breakthrough results are needed. Use analogy for 80% of routine decisions.

### Inversion Thinking

Instead of asking "How do I succeed?", ask "How do I guarantee failure?" Then systematically avoid those behaviors.

- **Core Question**: "What would guarantee failure?"
- **The Failure Pre-Mortem**:
  1. "It is 6 months from now. This has failed spectacularly."
  2. Write the failure narrative: "Here's what happened..."
  3. Extract specific failure points
  4. Create prevention strategies for each
- **Key Insight**: "It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent." - Charlie Munger

### Five Whys Method

Root cause analysis technique to drill past symptoms to fundamental causes or hidden assumptions.

- **Process**: Repeatedly ask "Why?" (typically 5 times) until you reach:
  - A falsifiable fact (first principle found!)
  - "Because I said so" / "That's just how it is" (assumption revealed!)
- **Example**: "I need to work 60 hours/week" → Why? → "Too much to do" → Why? → "Too many commitments" → Why? → "I say yes to everything" → Why? → "Fear of missing opportunities" → **Root**: FOMO drives overcommitment
- **Application**: Use on any problem, excuse, or limiting belief. Particularly powerful for stuck situations.

### Second-Order Thinking

Consider not just immediate consequences but chain reactions that follow from decisions.

- **Core Question**: "What happens in 2nd and 3rd order?"
- **Process** (10-10-10 Rule):
  - How will I feel about this in 10 minutes?
  - How will I feel in 10 months?
  - How will I feel in 10 years?
- **Mapping**:
  | Order | Question | Timeframe |
  |-------|----------|-----------|
  | 1st | What happens immediately? | Now - 1 month |
  | 2nd | What chain reactions follow? | 1-3 years |
  | 3rd | What long-term effects emerge? | 3-10 years |
- **Key Insight**: Many extraordinary outcomes are first-order negative but second-order positive (exercise: pain now, health later).

### One-Way/Two-Way Door Analysis

Framework for calibrating decision speed based on reversibility.

| Door Type | Definition | Approach |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **One-Way** | Irreversible or very hard to reverse | Slow down, gather information, run pre-mortem, consult advisors |
| **Two-Way** | Easily reversible with minimal cost | Decide with 70% of desired information, set review trigger, iterate |

**Key Questions**:
- "Can I easily reverse this if wrong?"
- "What's the cost of being wrong and needing to reverse?"
- "Can this one-way door be broken into smaller two-way door experiments?"

**Key Insight**: Treat one-way doors like one-way doors (deliberate carefully) and two-way doors like two-way doors (move fast).

### Mental Model Selection Guide

When to use which decision model:

| Situation | Recommended Models | Key Question |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Major life decision | First Principles + Inversion + Regret Minimization | "What would guarantee failure?" |
| New opportunity | Asymmetric Bets + Pareto + Opportunity Cost | "Is the upside-to-downside ratio at least 3:1?" |
| Recurring problem | Systems Thinking + Iceberg Model | "What mental model is generating this pattern?" |
| Overwhelm / too much | Via Negativa + Pareto | "What can I stop doing?" |
| Career move | Circle of Competence + One-Way Door + Second-Order | "Where will this lead in 10 years?" |
| Relationship issue | Second-Order Thinking + Inversion | "What would destroy this relationship?" |
| Time allocation | Pareto + Peak Energy Protection | "Which 20% creates 80% of value?" |
| Risk assessment | Asymmetric Bets + Margin of Safety | "Can I survive the worst case?" |
| Stuck / blocked | First Principles + Five Whys | "What assumption is creating this constraint?" |
| Planning session | Via Negativa + Pareto + Systems Thinking | "What feedback loops will this create?" |

### Quick Decision Filters

Use these as rapid screening questions before deeper analysis:

| Filter | Question | Red Flag Response |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Ruin Risk | "Could failure wipe me out?" | Yes = automatic no |
| Via Negativa | "Should I remove something instead of adding this?" | Often yes |
| Asymmetry | "Is upside at least 3x downside?" | No = reconsider |
| Vital Few | "Is this in my top 20%?" | No = likely defer |
| Reversibility | "Can I easily undo this?" | No = slow down |
| One Reason | "Is this decision obvious without multiple justifications?" | No = reconsider |
