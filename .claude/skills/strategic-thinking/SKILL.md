# Strategic Thinking Skill

Applies strategic frameworks including second-order thinking, decision classification, focus filters, and personal moat assessment.

## When to Activate

- Before major decisions (career, financial, relationship, strategic)
- When evaluating new opportunities or commitments
- During A-priority creation or assessment
- When user feels pulled in many directions
- During quarterly or annual planning
- When assessing whether to pursue something new
- When user asks "Should I...?" type questions

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Second-Order Thinking

Most regrets come from first-order thinking without considering consequences.

**The Process**:

| Order | Question | Timeframe |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 1st | What happens immediately? | Now - 1 month |
| 2nd | What chain reactions follow? | 1-3 years |
| 3rd | What long-term effects emerge? | 3-10 years |

**The 10-10-10 Rule**:
- How will I feel in **10 minutes**?
- How will I feel in **10 months**?
- How will I feel in **10 years**?

**Key Questions**:
- "And then what?" (Keep asking until you've mapped 3 orders)
- "If I do this consistently, what will my life look like in 10 years?"
- "What does this compound into over time?"

### 2. One-Way vs Two-Way Door Decisions

**One-Way Door (Type 1)** - Irreversible or very hard to reverse
- Examples: Major career change, having children, selling a business, breaking a partnership
- Approach: Slow down, gather information, run pre-mortem, consult advisors, consider smaller experiments

**Two-Way Door (Type 2)** - Easily reversible with minimal cost
- Examples: Most product features, hiring (with trial), new projects, testing a side business
- Approach: Decide quickly with 70% of desired information, set review trigger, iterate

**Stakes Assessment Matrix**:

| Stakes | Reversible (Two-Way) | Irreversible (One-Way) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **High** | Decide in 24-48 hours | Full analysis, pre-mortem, Board of Advisors |
| **Low** | Decide immediately | Quick inversion check, then decide |

**Key Insight**: Many one-way doors can be converted to two-way doors by running smaller experiments first.

### 3. Focus Filter Application

Apply to every new commitment:

**Primary Filter**: Does this align with current strategic priorities?
- For {{user_first_name}}: NFT + Physical + AI intersection
- Alignment = proceed to deeper analysis
- No alignment = requires strong justification or decline

**Secondary Filters**:
- Does this build or dilute my personal moat?
- Is this deepening expertise (T-vertical) or broadening it (T-horizontal)?
- What's the opportunity cost?
- Does this serve my mission of protecting what matters?

### 4. Personal Moat Assessment

A personal moat creates defensible advantages that compound over time.

**Components**:
- **Unique Skills**: What's easy for you but hard for others?
- **Uncommon Combinations**: What intersections do you own? (e.g., NFT + Physical + AI)
- **Reputation**: What keywords do you want associated with your name?
- **Relationships**: Who trusts you with important work?

**Key Questions**:
- "Does this deepen my moat or dilute it?"
- "Does this create unique combinations?"
- "Is this defensible long-term?"
- "What would I do even if I weren't paid?"

### 5. Strategic Patience vs Urgency

**S.T.O.P. Method** (When urgency hits):
1. **Signal** - What triggered this sense of urgency?
2. **Time** - Can I create space before responding?
3. **Orient** - What's actually happening?
4. **Proceed** - Do I have clarity to act, or am I reacting?

**Distinguishing Test**:
- Waiting because unclear/overwhelmed = Indecision (address the uncertainty)
- Waiting for defined signal/condition = Strategy (continue waiting)

**Warning Signs of Over-Waiting**:
- Repeated hesitation
- Growing anxiety
- External pressure building
- Opportunity decay
- Stagnation

## Quick Decision Filters

| Filter | Question | Red Flag Response |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **Regret Minimization** | "Will I regret NOT doing this at 80?" | No = lean toward doing it |
| **Hell Yes or No** | "Is this a HELL YES?" | Anything less = say no |
| **Focus Filter** | "Does this align with current priorities?" | No = defer |
| **Inversion** | "What would guarantee failure?" | Avoid anything on that list |
| **One Reason** | "Is there ONE good reason?" | Multiple reasons = rationalizing |
| **Reversibility** | "Can I easily undo this?" | No = slow down |

## Decision Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any major decision:

### Pre-Decision Checks
- [ ] Is this one-way or two-way door?
- [ ] Have I considered what could go wrong? (Inversion)
- [ ] Is the upside-to-downside ratio at least 3:1?
- [ ] Can I survive the worst case?
- [ ] Am I thinking from first principles or copying?
- [ ] What are the 2nd and 3rd order effects?
- [ ] Does this align with my values and mission?
- [ ] Who should I consult?

### Bias Checks
- [ ] Is this confidence or overconfidence?
- [ ] Am I continuing because of sunk cost or future value?
- [ ] Am I doing this because everyone else is?
- [ ] Am I listing many reasons (convincing myself)?

## Key Questions/Prompts

### Before Any Decision
- "Does this align with my 1-3 strategic priorities?"
- "Is this a one-way door or two-way door?"
- "What are the second and third-order consequences?"
- "Does this deepen my moat or dilute it?"

### During Task Assessment
- "This looks like an A-priority. What's the strategic value?"
- "This doesn't align with your focus filter. Should this be a B or C priority?"
- "You have 5 A-priorities. Which are truly strategic?"

### During Opportunity Evaluation
- "Does this deepen your T-shaped expertise or dilute it?"
- "What's the opportunity cost of this commitment?"
- "If starting from a blank slate, would you add this?"

## Integration Points

### With Daily Planning
- A-priorities should pass focus filter
- Check: "Does this serve strategic priorities or just feel urgent?"
- Max 3 A-tasks per day for better results

### With Board of Advisors
- Convene for one-way door decisions
- Ask advisors to apply second-order thinking
- Request blind spot identification

### With Goal Tracking
- Add "Focus Filter Check" to opportunity evaluation
- Assess moat-building potential of goals
- Track T-shaped development balance

### With Coaching
Before major decisions, Claude should ask:
- "Is this a one-way door? Should we slow down?"
- "What happens in the 2nd and 3rd order?"
- "Does this build or dilute your moat?"
- "Are you waiting strategically or avoiding action?"

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Analysis Paralysis | Never deciding | Set deadline, accept 70% info |
| Rationalizing | Listing many reasons | One Reason Rule |
| All Decisions Equal | Same process for everything | Categorize first (one-way/two-way) |
| Sunk Cost | "We've invested too much" | "Would I start this today?" |
| Shiny Object | Constant new priorities | Apply focus filter strictly |
| Over-Patience | Waiting without defined signal | Set exit condition |

## Coaching Triggers

- When user adds new commitment: "Does this pass your focus filter?"
- When user rushes big decision: "Is this a one-way door? Should we slow down?"
- When user defers repeatedly: "Are you waiting strategically or avoiding action?"
- When user lists multiple reasons: "If you need more than one reason, just don't do it."
- Before A-priority work: "What's the strategic value - does this build your moat?"
