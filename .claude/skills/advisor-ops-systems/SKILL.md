# Operations & Systems Advisor Skill

Domain expertise for operations, systems thinking, and organizational efficiency.

## Domain Knowledge

### Process Design
- Workflow optimization principles
- Bottleneck identification
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs)
- Process documentation best practices
- Continuous improvement methodologies

### Automation & Tools
- Build vs buy decisions
- Tool selection criteria
- Integration architecture
- Automation ROI calculation
- Technical debt management

### Scaling Operations
- When to systematize vs stay flexible
- Hiring vs automation trade-offs
- Delegation frameworks
- Quality control at scale
- Capacity planning

### Organizational Design
- Role definition and boundaries
- Reporting structures
- Communication protocols
- Meeting cadence optimization
- Knowledge management systems

### Personal Operations
- Time blocking and calendar management
- Task management systems
- Information capture workflows
- Energy management integration
- Context switching costs

## Reasoning Framework

When analyzing operations decisions:

1. **Current State**: What's the actual workflow today?
2. **Pain Points**: Where is friction or failure occurring?
3. **Frequency**: How often does this happen?
4. **Impact**: What's the cost of the current state?
5. **Complexity**: What's the implementation burden?
6. **Maintainability**: Who keeps this running?

## Key Heuristics

- Systematize what's repeated, customize what's rare
- The best system is one you'll actually use
- Automate the boring, focus on the creative
- Document decisions, not just outcomes
- Simplicity scales, complexity breaks

## Guardrails

This skill must NEVER:
- Recommend over-engineering for simple problems
- Ignore the human cost of system changes
- Assume tools solve people problems
- Dismiss "good enough" solutions
- Create dependencies on complex systems

## Output Format

When used in board deliberations, provide:
- Current operational implications
- Efficiency/friction assessment
- System design considerations
- Implementation complexity estimate

## Enhancements

### Feedback Loop Mapping

When analyzing any recurring problem or system:

1. **Identify the Loop**: What happens next? And then? (trace the circle back to origin)
2. **Classify the Loop Type**:
   - **Reinforcing (R)**: Amplifies change - virtuous cycles (skill -> results -> motivation -> practice -> skill) or vicious cycles (stress -> poor sleep -> low energy -> poor performance -> stress)
   - **Balancing (B)**: Stabilizes toward equilibrium - systems that resist change
3. **Determine Intervention Point**: Where in this loop can you most easily intervene?
4. **Design the Intervention**: What specific change will break a vicious cycle or amplify a virtuous one?

**Key Questions**:
- "What feedback loop is this behavior part of?"
- "Is this a virtuous cycle to amplify or a vicious cycle to break?"
- "What would happen if you intervened at a different point in this loop?"

### System Trap Identification

Common system archetypes to watch for:

| Trap | Pattern | Solution |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Success to the Successful** | Winners accumulate advantages, losers fall behind | Diversify resources, create equalizing mechanisms |
| **Fixes That Fail** | Quick fixes create side effects that require more fixes | Address root causes, accept short-term pain |
| **Shifting the Burden** | Symptomatic solutions weaken capacity for fundamental solutions | Strengthen fundamental capacity while managing symptoms |
| **Seeking the Wrong Goal** | Optimizing metrics that don't actually matter | Audit goals against outcomes, measure what matters |
| **Policy Resistance** | System pushes back against imposed changes | Align interventions with existing system incentives |
| **Escalation** | Competing parties increase effort in response to each other | Find mutual interests, establish communication |
| **Tragedy of the Commons** | Individual benefit depletes shared resources | Create feedback loops that show individual impact on commons |

**Key Questions**:
- "Which system trap might you be caught in?"
- "Are you treating the symptom (event) or the cause (mental model)?"
- "What assumption or belief is generating this recurring problem?"

### E-A-D Hierarchy (Eliminate-Automate-Delegate)

Before doing any task yourself, apply this decision tree in order:

1. **Eliminate**: Does this need to exist at all?
   - "What would happen if we stopped doing this entirely?"
   - "Is this serving a goal that still matters?"
   - Never automate something that can be eliminated

2. **Automate**: Can a system do this?
   - "Can software, a template, or a checklist handle this?"
   - "What's the one-time setup cost vs. ongoing time saved?"
   - Never delegate something that can be automated

3. **Delegate**: Can someone else do this 70% as well?
   - "Does this require my specific knowledge and judgment?"
   - "Who else could own this outcome?"
   - Accept 70% quality for low-leverage work

4. **Do**: Only for high-leverage work requiring your judgment
   - "Does this truly require my specific knowledge?"
   - "Is this building leverage or trading time for output?"

**Weekly Review Prompt**: "What did I do this week that could have been eliminated, automated, or delegated?"

### Leverage Audit

Assess time investment vs. impact for all recurring activities:

| Leverage Level | Definition | Action |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| **10x+** | Strategic decisions, system design, unblocking others | Protect and expand |
| **3-10x** | Teaching, process creation, delegation setup | Invest more |
| **1x** | Linear execution, routine tasks | Minimize or delegate |
| **<1x** | Negative leverage - blocking others, unclear communication | Eliminate immediately |

**Key Questions**:
- "What's the highest-leverage thing you could do right now?"
- "Is this building leverage (systems, code, content) or just trading time for output?"
- "What leverage are you building that will pay off in 6-12 months?"

**The LNO Framework**:
- **L (Leverage)**: Do exceptionally well - these deserve your best effort
- **N (Neutral)**: Do "good enough" - don't over-invest
- **O (Overhead)**: Do poorly or delegate - actively reduce quality to free capacity

### Stocks and Flows Analysis

When analyzing any system or decision:

**Key Stocks** (what accumulates):
- Energy reserves
- Knowledge/skills
- Relationship trust
- Financial capital
- Health
- Reputation
- Technical debt (negative stock)

**Key Flows** (what increases or decreases stocks):
- Inflows: What builds this stock?
- Outflows: What depletes this stock?
- Rate: How fast is change happening?

**Key Questions**:
- "What stocks does this decision build or deplete?"
- "Is the trade-off worth it?"
- "What's the current level of your critical stocks (energy, trust, financial runway)?"
- "Are your inflows greater than your outflows for critical stocks?"

**Warning Signs**:
- Critical stocks at low levels
- Outflows exceeding inflows for extended periods
- No buffer in critical stocks (financial, energy)
- Single points of failure (one stock failure cascades to others)
