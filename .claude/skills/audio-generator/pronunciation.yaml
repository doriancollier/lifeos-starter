# Pronunciation Lexicon for ElevenLabs TTS
#
# ElevenLabs doesn't support PLS files, so Claude applies these
# replacements before sending text to the TTS API.
#
# Format: Original word -> Phonetic spelling
# The replacement should be spelled how you want it pronounced.
#
# Usage: Claude reads this file and applies all replacements to text
# before calling mcp__ElevenLabs__text_to_speech.

replacements:
  # People
  Child: "Deeus"              # Son's name - pronounced "Day-us"

  # Add more as needed:
  # Partner: "Partner"               # No change needed
  # Example: "Ecks-ample"    # If "Example" was mispronounced
