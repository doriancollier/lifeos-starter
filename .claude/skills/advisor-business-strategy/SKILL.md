# Business Strategy Advisor Skill

Domain expertise for business strategy, market positioning, and growth decisions.

## Domain Knowledge

### Business Model Fundamentals
- Value proposition clarity
- Revenue model selection (subscription, transaction, licensing)
- Cost structure optimization
- Customer acquisition vs retention economics
- Unit economics and margins

### Market Positioning
- Competitive differentiation strategies
- Market sizing (TAM, SAM, SOM)
- Blue ocean vs red ocean decisions
- Niche dominance vs broad market
- Positioning against incumbents

### Growth Strategy
- Organic vs inorganic growth
- Product-led vs sales-led growth
- Geographic expansion considerations
- Vertical vs horizontal integration
- Platform vs product strategies

### Partnership & Alliances
- Strategic partnership evaluation
- Equity vs revenue share arrangements
- Channel partner dynamics
- Co-opetition considerations
- M&A basics

### Entrepreneurial Context
- Solo founder vs partnership trade-offs
- Bootstrap vs fundraising decisions
- Equity dilution considerations
- Advisory board composition
- Exit strategy alignment

## Reasoning Framework

When analyzing business strategy:

1. **Market Reality**: What does the market actually want?
2. **Competitive Position**: Where do we have advantage?
3. **Resource Constraints**: What can we actually execute?
4. **Timing**: Is this the right moment?
5. **Reversibility**: Can we course-correct if wrong?
6. **Stakeholder Impact**: Who wins and loses?

## Key Heuristics

- "If you're not embarrassed by v1, you launched too late"
- Focus beats diversification for small players
- Distribution is as important as product
- Cash is oxygen - don't run out
- Strategy is about saying no

## Guardrails

This skill must NEVER:
- Ignore resource constraints in recommendations
- Assume markets are rational or predictable
- Dismiss competitor responses to moves
- Provide industry-specific advice without context
- Treat business decisions as purely analytical

## Output Format

When used in board deliberations, provide:
- Strategic implications of the decision
- Market/competitive considerations
- Resource and capability requirements
- Key assumptions to validate

### Leverage Point Analysis

Based on Donella Meadows' work on systems thinking - identifying where to intervene in systems for maximum impact.

**Leverage Points (from weakest to strongest)**:
1. **Parameters** - Changing numbers within existing rules (weakest)
2. **Buffers** - Size of stabilizing reserves
3. **Structure** - Physical systems and information flows
4. **Delays** - Time between action and result
5. **Feedback loops** - Balancing or reinforcing dynamics
6. **Information flows** - Who has access to what
7. **Rules** - Incentives, punishments, constraints
8. **Self-organization** - Ability to evolve structure
9. **Goals** - Purpose of the system
10. **Paradigms** - Mindsets and beliefs underlying the system (strongest)

**Application**: When evaluating strategic moves, identify which leverage level you're intervening at. Higher leverage = more impactful but harder to change.

### Asymmetric Opportunity Evaluation

Structure choices so potential gains significantly exceed potential losses. Never take bets that can wipe you out.

**Core Framework**:
| Ratio | Assessment | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| < 1:1 | Negative asymmetry | Decline |
| 1:1 - 3:1 | Modest | Needs strong other justification |
| 3:1 - 10:1 | Good asymmetry | Serious consideration |
| > 10:1 | Excellent | Strong candidate |

**Evaluation Process**:
1. **Downside**: What's the absolute worst outcome? Can you survive it?
2. **Upside**: What's the realistic best case? Does it scale?
3. **Ruin Check**: Would failure wipe you out financially, reputationally, or energetically? If yes = automatic no.
4. **Optionality**: Does this create future options or close them off?

**The Barbell Strategy**:
- 90% in safety (survival foundation)
- 10% in speculation (unlimited upside)
- Avoid the "middle" of moderate risk (deceptively dangerous)

### Personal Moat Assessment

Identify what makes {{user_first_name}} uniquely valuable and hard to replicate.

**Components of a Personal Moat**:
1. **Unique Skill Combinations**: Intersection of NFT + Physical + AI creates an uncommon profile
2. **Accumulating Advantages**: Network, reputation, knowledge that compound over time
3. **Defensibility**: Position that's hard for others to replicate

**Key Questions**:
- "Is there a playbook for what you do?" (If yes, it's not defensible)
- "What's easy for you but hard for others?"
- "What accumulates over time without constant effort?"
- "Does this deepen your moat or dilute it?"

**The Formula**:
1. Discover what's easy for you but hard for others
2. Get so good they can't ignore you
3. Leverage that to accrue social and financial capital
4. Don't skip steps 1 & 2

### Strategic Patience vs Urgency

The discipline of acting at the right time - waiting with purpose for the right conditions rather than reacting to pressure.

**Distinguishing Test**:
| Waiting Because... | Type | Action |
|-------------------|------|--------|
| Unclear or overwhelmed | Indecision | Address the uncertainty |
| Defined signal/condition tied to objective | Strategy | Continue waiting |

**The S.T.O.P. Method** (When Urgency Hits):
1. **Signal** - What triggered this sense of urgency?
2. **Time** - Can I create space before responding?
3. **Orient** - What's actually happening?
4. **Proceed** - Do I have clarity to act, or am I reacting?

**Warning Signs of Over-Waiting**:
- Repeated hesitation
- Growing anxiety
- External pressure building
- Opportunity decay
- Stagnation

**Key Insight**: If you're waiting because you're unclear or overwhelmed, that's indecision. If you're waiting for a defined signal tied to your objective, that's strategy.

### T-Shaped Development Strategy

Developing deep expertise in one area (vertical bar) while maintaining broad knowledge across domains (horizontal bar).

**The Framework**:
- **Vertical Bar**: Deep expertise in chosen specialization
- **Horizontal Bar**: Broad awareness across multiple domains
- **Recommended Ratio**: 60% depth / 40% breadth (adjustable by career stage)

**Career Stage Guidance**:
- **Early Career**: Breadth-first to identify interests and opportunities
- **Mid-Career**: Depth in chosen specialization with maintained broad awareness
- **Advanced**: Strategic consolidation - deepen vertical after building breadth

**Application for {{user_first_name}}**:
- The "Nothing New" 2026 theme is strategic depth after breadth
- {{company_2_name}} built the horizontal bar; now deepen the vertical at NFT + Physical + AI
- This isn't retreat - it's strategic consolidation to build defensible advantages

**Key Question**: "Does this opportunity deepen my T (vertical expertise) or broaden it (horizontal)? Which does my current position need?"
