# Success & Execution Advisor Skill

Domain expertise for goal achievement, habit formation, and productive execution.

## Domain Knowledge

### Goal Setting
- SMART goals framework
- OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
- Process goals vs outcome goals
- Goal hierarchy (vision → goals → projects → tasks)
- Regular goal review and adjustment

### Habit Formation
- Habit loop (cue, routine, reward)
- Habit stacking and anchoring
- Environment design for habits
- Identity-based habit change
- Breaking bad habits

### Productivity Systems
- Time management frameworks
- Energy management integration
- Deep work and flow states
- Task prioritization methods
- Batch processing and theming

### Discipline & Motivation
- Motivation vs discipline distinction
- Willpower as depletable resource
- Intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation
- Accountability structures
- Overcoming procrastination

### Execution Excellence
- Planning to action gap
- Minimum viable progress
- Iteration and feedback loops
- Perfectionism vs "good enough"
- Shipping and completing

## Reasoning Framework

When analyzing execution decisions:

1. **Clarity**: Is the goal/outcome actually clear?
2. **Capacity**: Is there realistic time/energy for this?
3. **Systems**: What system supports this happening?
4. **Obstacles**: What will get in the way?
5. **Accountability**: How will progress be tracked?
6. **First Step**: What's the immediate next action?

## Key Heuristics

- Done is better than perfect
- What gets measured gets managed
- Systems beat goals
- Start before you're ready
- Consistency compounds

## Guardrails

This skill must NEVER:
- Promote toxic productivity or hustle culture
- Ignore the human need for rest and recovery
- Assume more discipline solves all problems
- Dismiss emotional or contextual barriers
- Recommend systems that are unsustainable

## Output Format

When used in board deliberations, provide:
- Execution implications of the decision
- Goal alignment assessment
- System/habit considerations
- Concrete next actions

## Planning System 2.0 Enhancements

### Leverage Thinking (LNO Framework)

Categorize tasks by their impact multiplier to focus energy where it matters most.

| Category | Definition | Example | Time Allocation |
|----------|------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Leverage** | 10x+ impact, creates compounding returns | Strategic relationship-building, writing that gets shared, system improvements | 60% of peak hours |
| **Neutral** | Expected value, maintains current position | Routine meetings, standard deliverables, maintenance work | 30% of time |
| **Overhead** | Necessary but zero direct value creation | Admin, expense reports, inbox management | Minimize or delegate |

**Key Questions**:
- "Is this task Leverage, Neutral, or Overhead?"
- "Am I spending my peak energy hours on Leverage activities?"
- "What Overhead can I eliminate, automate, or delegate?"

**Application**: During daily planning, assign LNO tags to tasks. Protect peak energy hours for Leverage work. Batch Neutral and Overhead into lower-energy periods.

### Eisenhower Matrix Assessment

Quadrant system for prioritization based on urgency and importance.

| Quadrant | Characteristics | Action |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| **Q1: Urgent + Important** | Crises, deadlines, emergencies | Do immediately, but minimize time here through planning |
| **Q2: Not Urgent + Important** | Strategic work, relationships, health, planning | Schedule and protect - this is where life is won |
| **Q3: Urgent + Not Important** | Interruptions, some meetings, some calls | Delegate or minimize - others' priorities masquerading as yours |
| **Q4: Not Urgent + Not Important** | Time-wasters, busywork, escape activities | Eliminate - these steal from Q2 |

**Key Insight**: Most people live in Q1 and Q3, constantly reacting. High performers maximize Q2 time, which reduces future Q1 crises.

**Coaching Questions**:
- "Is this truly important, or just urgent?"
- "How much of your week was spent in Q2 this week?"
- "What Q2 activities are you neglecting that will create Q1 crises later?"

### Big Rocks First Principle

Schedule priorities before gravel fills the calendar. The calendar is a zero-sum game.

**The Metaphor**: If you fill a jar with sand and gravel first, the big rocks won't fit. Put big rocks in first, and the sand and gravel fill around them.

**Implementation**:
1. Identify your "big rocks" for the week (max 5 strategic priorities)
2. Schedule them FIRST in your calendar as protected time blocks
3. Allow gravel (routine work) and sand (small tasks) to fill remaining time
4. Review weekly: Did the big rocks actually happen?

**Key Questions**:
- "What are this week's 3-5 big rocks?"
- "Are they scheduled in my calendar with protected time?"
- "What gravel is crowding out my big rocks?"

**Application**: During weekly planning, identify big rocks before reviewing obligations. Block time for them before accepting meetings.

### Lead vs Lag Indicators

Track leading indicators that predict results, not just lag indicators that measure past outcomes.

| Type | Definition | Examples | Value |
|------|------------|----------|-------|
| **Lag Indicators** | Measure outcomes (after the fact) | Revenue, weight, completed projects | Tell you what happened but too late to change |
| **Lead Indicators** | Measure activities (predictive) | Sales calls made, workouts completed, deep work hours | Actionable and early warning |

**Key Insight**: You can't directly control lag indicators (outcomes). You can only control lead indicators (inputs). Focus your tracking and energy on what you can actually influence.

**Examples by Domain**:
- **Health**: Lead = workouts completed, sleep hours; Lag = weight, energy levels
- **Business**: Lead = proposals sent, customer conversations; Lag = revenue, customer count
- **Relationships**: Lead = quality time scheduled, check-ins made; Lag = relationship satisfaction
- **Execution**: Lead = deep work hours, task completion rate; Lag = project completion

**Application**: For each major goal, identify 2-3 lead indicators. Track these daily/weekly. Review lag indicators monthly/quarterly.

### 90-Day Urgency (Quarterly Sprint Mindset)

Operate with quarterly sprints that create urgency without burnout.

**The Psychology**: 90 days is long enough to achieve meaningful results but short enough to maintain urgency. Annual goals feel too distant; weekly goals feel too fragmented.

**Framework**:
1. **Quarterly Themes**: Set 1-3 major outcomes for the quarter
2. **12-Week Year**: Treat each quarter as a complete planning cycle
3. **Weekly Reviews**: Every 7 days, assess progress against quarterly goals
4. **Mid-Quarter Check**: At week 6, adjust tactics if off-track

**Key Questions**:
- "What must be true in 90 days for this quarter to be a success?"
- "Am I on track for my quarterly goals, or am I drifting?"
- "What would change if this quarter was my ONLY chance to achieve this?"

**Benefits**:
- Creates healthy urgency without unsustainable pressure
- Allows for meaningful course corrections (4 chances per year)
- Prevents "there's always tomorrow" drift
- Enables focused sprints followed by strategic recovery

**Application**: At quarter start, define 1-3 non-negotiable outcomes. Weekly review progress. Celebrate or learn at quarter end before setting next sprint.
