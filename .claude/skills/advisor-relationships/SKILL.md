## Reasoning Framework

When analyzing relationship decisions:

1. **Relationship Health**: What's the current state of trust?
2. **Stakeholders**: Who is affected by this decision?
3. **Communication**: How will this be perceived/received?
4. **Long-term**: What does this do to the relationship over time?
5. **Repair**: If this causes damage, can it be repaired?
6. **Patterns**: Is this part of a larger dynamic?

## Key Heuristics

- Assume positive intent until proven otherwise
- Relationships are built in small moments
- What you tolerate, you teach
- Vulnerability builds trust faster than performance
- Every relationship needs investment

## Planning System 2.0: {{partner_name}}-Specific Context

{{partner_name}} is both life partner AND business partner (EMC), requiring careful context separation.

### The 5:1 Magic Ratio (Gottman)

The ratio of positive to negative interactions that distinguishes stable, happy marriages from those headed for divorce.

**During conflict**: Successful couples maintain approximately 5 positive interactions for every 1 negative interaction.

**Application**:
- Track daily: Did I have more positive than negative interactions today?
- Weekly State of Union: Express 5 specific appreciations each
- During conflict: Make repair attempts to prevent ratio from tanking
- Build "positive sentiment override" so neutral actions are perceived positively
- Small, everyday moments matter more than grand gestures

### The Four Horsemen and Antidotes

Four communication patterns that predict divorce with 94% accuracy:

| Horseman | How It Shows | Antidote | Action |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Criticism** | "You always..." / "You never..." (attacking character) | Gentle Start-Up | Lead with "I feel..." not "You always..." |
| **Contempt** | Eye-rolling, mockery, superiority, disdain | Build Culture of Appreciation | Daily appreciation, 5:1 ratio maintenance |
| **Defensiveness** | "Yes, but..." / refusing to own your part | Take Responsibility | Own your 5%, avoid "Yes, but..." |
| **Stonewalling** | Shutting down, withdrawing, refusing to engage | Self-Soothe | "I need 20 minutes to calm down" |

**Key insight**: Contempt is the single biggest predictor of divorce. It's built on moral superiority—making the culture of appreciation the critical antidote.

### Bids for Connection

A bid is any attempt to connect—a comment, question, gesture, or touch that says "I want to engage with you."

**Response options**:
- Turn toward (respond positively)
- Turn away (ignore)
- Turn against (reject)

**Research finding**: Couples who turned toward bids 86% of the time remained married after six years; those who divorced averaged only 33%.

**Application**:
- Morning: Notice and respond to first bids of the day
- During work: Respond to texts/messages, don't just ignore
- Evening: Put phone down when partner speaks
- Track: "Did I turn toward or away today?"

Most bids are mundane—"Look at that," "Did you hear about X?"—not dramatic requests. Missing these small moments erodes connection invisibly.

### Repair Attempts

Any statement or action that prevents negativity from escalating during conflict.

**Six repair categories**:
1. "I Feel" statements
2. "I'm Sorry" acknowledgments
3. "Get to Yes" compromise offers
4. "I Need to Calm Down" requests
5. "Stop Action" pauses
6. "I Appreciate" affirmations

**Key insight**: Repair attempts predict long-term success even more than conflict style. It's not whether you fight, but whether you can stop the escalation.

**Application**:
- Memorize repair phrases: "Let's start over," "Can we pause?," "I'm sorry for my part"
- Practice accepting: When partner offers repair, choose to step back from the fight
- Repair within 3 hours strengthens trust instead of eroding it
- Post-conflict: Use aftermath process to complete repair

### State of Union Practice (Weekly Ritual)

A structured 60-minute weekly meeting with four parts:

| Part | Duration | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Appreciations | 10-15 min | 5 specific appreciations each |
| What's Working | 10-15 min | Celebrate wins, reinforce positive |
| Concerns | 20-25 min | Address issues with ATTUNE mindset |
| Closing Affirmation | 5-10 min | End on connection |

**ATTUNE mindset** for concern discussion:
- **A**wareness of partner's feelings
- **T**olerance for different perspectives
- **T**urning Toward bids for connection
- **U**nderstanding partner's needs
- **N**on-defensive Listening
- **E**mpathy

**Key**: Separate from EMC business discussions. Never skip—consistency builds trust.

### Love Maps (Know Partner's Inner World)

Deep knowledge of partner's dreams, fears, stressors, joys, and current world.

**Areas to maintain awareness of**:
- Current work projects and stressors
- Health and wellness state
- Family dynamics and concerns
- Short and long-term dreams
- What makes her feel loved
- Things she's looking forward to / dreading

**Practice**: Update Love Map knowledge monthly. Ask questions to fill gaps.

**Recovery prompt**: "What are {{partner_name}}'s top 3 stressors right now? What is she excited about? If you don't know, you've been taking her for granted."

### Key Prompts for Partner Role

**On Daily Connection**:
- "Did I turn toward {{partner_name}}'s bids for connection today, or was I too absorbed in my own world?"
- "Did I express at least one specific appreciation?"

**On Communication**:
- "Did any of the Four Horsemen show up in my communication today?"
- "Could this land warmer without losing clarity?"

**On Conflict**:
- "What's my part in this? (Even 5%)"
- "Did I make or accept a repair attempt during our last conflict?"

**On EMC Separation**:
- "Are EMC conversations dominating our personal time?"
- "When did we last have a conversation that wasn't about business?"

**On Investment**:
- "Am I treating {{partner_name}} as A-priority or just saying I am?"
- "Is my calendar reflecting that Partner > Professional Work?"
