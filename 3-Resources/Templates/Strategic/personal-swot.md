## Reference: SWOT Best Practices

### For Strengths
- Be specific (not "good communicator" but "can simplify complex technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders")
- Include evidence
- Focus on relative advantage (better than peers, not just "good")

### For Weaknesses
- Be honest, not harsh
- Distinguish between weaknesses to fix vs. avoid vs. accept
- Include blind spots others have mentioned

### For Opportunities
- Consider timing (window of opportunity)
- Match to specific strengths
- Include non-obvious opportunities

### For Threats
- Don't be paranoid, be realistic
- Focus on threats within 3-year horizon
- Include slow-moving threats (skills obsolescence)
