# Leverage Point Audit

> [!ai-context]
> Use this template to evaluate current interventions and identify opportunities to work at higher leverage levels. Based on Donella Meadows' 12 Leverage Points framework.

## Current Intervention

### What I'm Trying to Change

**Situation/Problem:**

**Current Approach:**

**Resources Invested:** (time, energy, money)

**Duration of Effort:**

## Leverage Level Assessment

### The 12 Leverage Points (Low to High)

Rate your current intervention and identify higher-leverage alternatives:

| Level | Leverage Point | Description | Current? | Alternative? |
|-------|---------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| **12** | Constants/Parameters | Numbers (quotas, standards, budgets) | [ ] | |
| **11** | Buffer Sizes | Size of stabilizing stocks | [ ] | |
| **10** | Physical Structure | Infrastructure, layout, connections | [ ] | |
| **9** | Delays | Time between cause and effect | [ ] | |
| **8** | Balancing Loops | Strength of negative feedback | [ ] | |
| **7** | Reinforcing Loops | Strength of positive feedback | [ ] | |
| **6** | Information Flows | Who knows what, when | [ ] | |
| **5** | System Rules | Incentives, constraints, policies | [ ] | |
| **4** | Self-Organization | Ability to change structure | [ ] | |
| **3** | System Goals | What the system optimizes for | [ ] | |
| **2** | Paradigms | Mindset, worldview, beliefs | [ ] | |
| **1** | Transcendence | Ability to change paradigms | [ ] | |

## Higher-Leverage Opportunities

### Level 6: Information Flows

_What information, if visible, would change behavior?_

**Current information gaps:**

**Potential dashboards/metrics:**

**Who needs to know what:**

### Level 5: System Rules

_What rules/policies/incentives drive current behavior?_

**Current rules creating the problem:**

**New rules that would solve it:**

**Personal policies/non-negotiables to establish:**

### Level 4-3: Goals and Self-Organization

_What is the system optimizing for? Is that the right goal?_

**Current optimization target:**

**Should I be optimizing for something else?**

**What structure changes would enable better self-organization?**

### Level 2: Paradigms

_What beliefs or mental models underlie this system?_

**Current paradigm/assumption:**

**Alternative paradigm:**

**Evidence challenging the current paradigm:**

## Reference: Leverage Level Examples

### Low Leverage (Parameters - Level 12)
- "I'll wake up 30 minutes earlier"
- "I'll work harder"
- "I'll set a bigger budget"

### Medium Leverage (Information/Rules - Levels 5-6)
- Creating visible dashboards for key metrics
- Establishing "no meeting" time blocks
- Setting up accountability systems

### High Leverage (Goals/Paradigms - Levels 2-3)
- Changing success metrics from output to outcomes
- Shifting from "productivity" to "impact" mindset
- Redefining what "winning" means in a domain

### Highest Leverage (Transcendence - Level 1)
- Recognizing that paradigms are choices, not reality
- Developing ability to hold multiple perspectives
- Building capacity to question any assumption
