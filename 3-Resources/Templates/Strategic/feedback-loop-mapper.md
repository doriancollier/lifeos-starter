# Feedback Loop Mapper

> [!ai-context]
> Use this template to identify and visualize the reinforcing (R) and balancing (B) loops operating in any life domain. The goal is to determine which loops to amplify and which to break.

## Target Behavior/Outcome

**What behavior or outcome am I trying to understand?**

_Describe the situation, habit, or result you want to analyze_

---

## Loop Identification

### Step 1: Trace the Circle

Start with the behavior and ask "What happens next?" repeatedly until you return to the starting point.

| Step | What Happens | Leads To |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | | |
| 2 | | |
| 3 | | |
| 4 | | |
| 5 | _(back to step 1?)_ | |

### Step 2: Visual Loop Diagram

```
     ┌─────────────────┐
     │                 │
     v                 │
  [Element A]          │
     │                 │
     │ (+/-)           │ (+/-)
     v                 │
  [Element B]          │
     │                 │
     │ (+/-)           │
     v                 │
  [Element C] ─────────┘
```

_Replace elements with your specific variables. Mark connections as (+) for same direction or (-) for opposite direction._

## Loop Classification

### Loop Type

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Does change amplify itself?** (growth or decline accelerates) | Yes / No |
| **Does change stabilize?** (system returns toward equilibrium) | Yes / No |

**Loop Type**: [ ] Reinforcing (R) - Amplifying | [ ] Balancing (B) - Stabilizing

### Loop Direction (if Reinforcing)

| Direction | Description | This Loop |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Virtuous Cycle** | Amplifies positive outcomes | [ ] |
| **Vicious Cycle** | Amplifies negative outcomes | [ ] |

---

## Loop Analysis

### Current State Assessment

| Question | Response |
|----------|----------|
| **How strong is this loop currently?** | Weak / Moderate / Strong |
| **How long has this loop been active?** | |
| **What triggered this loop?** | |
| **What keeps it running?** | |

### Impact Assessment

| Impact Area | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Energy | |
| Relationships | |
| Work/Career | |
| Health | |
| Finances | |
| Mental State | |

---

## Intervention Strategy

### Potential Intervention Points

For each element in the loop, assess intervention feasibility:

| Element | Ease of Change | Impact if Changed | Priority |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| | Low / Med / High | Low / Med / High | |
| | Low / Med / High | Low / Med / High | |
| | Low / Med / High | Low / Med / High | |

### Selected Intervention Point

**Where will I intervene?**

_Choose the point with the best ease-to-impact ratio_

**Why this point?**

---

## Action Plan

### If Virtuous Cycle: Amplify

| Action | Timeline | Success Indicator |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

### If Vicious Cycle: Break

| Action | Timeline | Success Indicator |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

---

## Monitoring

### Check-In Schedule

| Date | Loop Status | Adjustments Needed |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| +1 week | | |
| +2 weeks | | |
| +1 month | | |

## Reference: Common Life Loops

### Virtuous Cycles to Cultivate
- **Skill Loop**: Practice -> Skill -> Results -> Motivation -> Practice
- **Energy Loop**: Exercise -> Energy -> Better Sleep -> Recovery -> More Exercise
- **Trust Loop**: Reliability -> Trust -> Opportunities -> Prove Reliability
- **Learning Loop**: Curiosity -> Learning -> Competence -> Confidence -> More Curiosity

### Vicious Cycles to Break
- **Stress Loop**: Stress -> Poor Sleep -> Low Energy -> Poor Performance -> More Stress
- **Avoidance Loop**: Fear -> Avoidance -> Skill Atrophy -> More Fear
- **Debt Loop**: Scarcity -> Poor Decisions -> More Debt -> More Scarcity
- **Isolation Loop**: Withdrawal -> Loneliness -> Depression -> More Withdrawal
