# Boundaries Audit

> Boundaries protect relationships and priorities from becoming unsafe or neglected. They are "fortifications" that enable deeper connection, not walls that create isolation.

## Boundary Definition

A healthy boundary is something you set for yourself, rooted in your own needs, limits, and values. It is NOT an attempt to control others' behavior.

**Purpose of boundaries**:
- Protect what matters most
- Enable presence and focus
- Create safety for relationships
- Preserve energy for high-value activities

| Morning routine protection | | | |
| Evening wind-down | | | |
| Weekend boundaries | | | |

### Energy Boundaries

| Boundary | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Say no to: | | |
| Delegate: | | |
| Limit exposure to: | | |
| Protect high-energy for: | | |

### Communication Boundaries

| Boundary | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Slack after hours | | |
| Email response expectations | | |
| Meeting-free time | | |
| Availability communication | | |

## Protected vs. Flexible vs. Integration Time

### Protected Time (Non-Negotiable)

These cannot be moved without significant justification.

| Commitment | When | What It Protects |
|------------|------|------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### Flexible Time (Can Shift)

These have default timing but can move when needed.

| Activity | Default Timing | Acceptable Shifts |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### Integration Time (Deliberate Blending)

These intentionally combine domains.

| Activity | How It Blends Domains |

## Boundary Leak Assessment

### Where Are My Boundaries Leaking?

**Time leaks** (where does time disappear?):
-

**Energy leaks** (what drains without return?):
-

**Attention leaks** (what fragments focus?):
-

**Commitment leaks** (where do I overcommit?):
-

### Root Causes of Leaks

- [ ] Fear of disappointing others
- [ ] Unclear priorities
- [ ] Poor communication of boundaries
- [ ] Lack of systems to enforce boundaries
- [ ] Guilt about saying no
- [ ] Not valuing own needs
- [ ] External pressure/expectations
- [ ] Other:

### Which Leaks Are Most Costly?

## Boundary Violation Tracking

Track violations over time to identify patterns.

| Date | Boundary Violated | Trigger | Impact | Learning |
|------|-------------------|---------|--------|----------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

### Patterns I Notice


### Boundaries I Break Most Often


### What Makes Me Vulnerable to Violations?

## Boundary Strengthening Plan

### Boundaries That Need Reinforcement

| Boundary | Current State | Desired State | Action to Strengthen |
|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### New Boundaries Needed

| Need | Proposed Boundary | How to Communicate |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

### Boundaries to Release

> Some boundaries may be too rigid or no longer serve their purpose.

| Current Boundary | Why Release | What Replaces It |
|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| | | |

## Communicating Boundaries

> Communicate boundaries with warmth: "I need time to recharge so I can be more present with you."

### Template Language

**Setting a new boundary**:
"I've realized I need [boundary] so that I can [positive outcome for them/relationship]. Can we talk about how to make this work?"

**Reinforcing an existing boundary**:
"I care about [relationship/commitment], and protecting [boundary] helps me show up better. I appreciate your understanding."

**Recovering from a violation**:
"I let [boundary] slip, and I noticed [impact]. I'm recommitting to [boundary] because [reason]."

### Who Needs to Know About My Boundaries?

| Person | Boundaries to Communicate | How/When to Communicate |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

## Boundary Self-Assessment

### How Well Am I Holding My Boundaries?

Rate 1-5 (1 = constantly violated, 5 = consistently held)

- Work hours boundaries: /5
- Family time boundaries: /5
- Personal recovery boundaries: /5
- Communication boundaries: /5
- Energy protection boundaries: /5

**Overall boundary health**: /25

### What Would Improve by 1 Point?

## Reflection Prompts

**On Boundary Setting**:
- "What do I need that I'm not giving myself permission to need?"
- "What am I protecting with this boundary?"
- "Is this boundary serving connection or creating isolation?"

**On Boundary Violations**:
- "Your boundary was [X]. You broke it [frequency]. What boundary will you actually keep?"
- "You're saying yes to everything. What are you really saying no to? Your health? Your family?"

**On Boundary Communication**:
- "Have I communicated this boundary clearly, or am I expecting others to read my mind?"
- "Could I communicate this boundary with more warmth?"

**On Boundary Balance**:
- "Is this boundary too rigid? Am I missing connection opportunities?"
- "Is this boundary too loose? What's the cost of not protecting this?"
