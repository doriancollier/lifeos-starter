# Burnout Prevention

> Without recovery, stress leads to burnout. With strategic recovery, stress leads to growth.

## The Three Rs of Sustainable Performance

### Respite
Regular breaks from work to allow recovery.
- [ ] Did I take regular breaks from work this week?
- [ ] Did I have at least one full day without work?
- [ ] Did I take 15-20 minute recovery breaks between work sprints?

### Regimen
Maintaining foundational health practices.
- [ ] Did I maintain my sleep schedule (7-8 hours)?
- [ ] Did I exercise or move my body regularly?
- [ ] Did I eat in a way that supports energy?
- [ ] Did I limit substances that impair recovery?

### Disengagement
Structured work-off time where work doesn't intrude.
- [ ] Did I have times where work was completely off?
- [ ] Did I resist checking work communication outside hours?
- [ ] Did I mentally disengage, not just physically?

**How many Rs are green?** /3
- 3/3: Sustainable zone
- 2/3: Caution - address the gap
- 1/3 or less: Burnout risk - immediate intervention needed

## Recovery vs. Avoidance

> Not all rest is recovery. Learn to distinguish.

### Strategic Recovery (Sustainable)
- Restores energy and capacity
- Aligned with values
- Creates readiness for engagement
- Feels restorative afterward

### Avoidance (Not Sustainable)
- Numbs or distracts
- Often misaligned with values
- Creates guilt or more depletion
- Feels empty afterward

### Am I Recovering or Avoiding?

Current activities I'm calling "rest":

| Activity | Recovery or Avoidance? | How I Feel After |
|----------|----------------------|------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

## Support System

### Who Can I Turn To?

| Person | Type of Support They Offer | How to Reach Out |

| | | |

### Professional Resources

### What Makes It Hard to Ask for Help?

## Reflection Prompts

**On Current State**:
- "Am I experiencing stress (temporary, recoverable) or burnout (accumulated, systemic)?"
- "Which of the Three Rs am I neglecting?"
- "What warning signs am I ignoring?"

**On Recovery**:
- "Is this activity actually restoring me, or just numbing me?"
- "What would real rest look like right now?"
- "Am I treating recovery as a performance strategy or as weakness?"

**On Prevention**:
- "What patterns lead me toward burnout?"
- "What would sustainable look like for me?"
- "Am I building recovery into my system, or hoping willpower will be enough?"

**On Compassion**:
- "If a friend described this situation, what would I tell them?"
- "What do I need that I'm not giving myself permission to need?"
- "Can I be as kind to myself as I would be to someone I love?"
