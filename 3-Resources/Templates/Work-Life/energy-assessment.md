# Energy Assessment

> Energy is the fundamental currency of high performance. You cannot create more hours, but you can optimize energy quality and capacity.

## Quick Energy Check

Rate each dimension 1-10 (1 = depleted, 10 = fully charged):

| Dimension | Level | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Physical | /10 | Sleep, nutrition, movement, physical vitality |
| Emotional | /10 | Mood, patience, connection capacity |
| Mental | /10 | Focus, clarity, decision quality |
| Spiritual | /10 | Purpose, meaning, alignment with values |

**Overall Energy**: /40

## Energy Allocation Plan

### High-Energy Window
- **When**:
- **Protected for**:
- **What I'll accomplish**:

### Current Energy State Assessment

**If total is 30+**: Full capacity day - tackle challenging work
**If total is 20-29**: Moderate capacity - focus on one priority, protect recovery
**If total is under 20**: Recovery mode - essential tasks only, prioritize restoration

### Recovery Needs

- [ ] Do I need physical recovery? (sleep, rest, movement)
- [ ] Do I need emotional recovery? (connection, solitude, joy)
- [ ] Do I need mental recovery? (breaks, variety, reduced cognitive load)
- [ ] Do I need spiritual recovery? (meaning, purpose reconnection, values alignment)

**Recovery action for today**:

## Energy Patterns (Weekly View)

Use this section during weekly review to identify patterns.

| Day | Physical | Emotional | Mental | Spiritual | Notes |
|-----|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Mon | | | | | |
| Tue | | | | | |
| Wed | | | | | |
| Thu | | | | | |
| Fri | | | | | |
| Sat | | | | | |
| Sun | | | | | |

### Pattern Recognition

**What depletes my energy?**
-

**What restores my energy?**

**Best time for deep work**:
**Best time for recovery**:

## Sprint + Recovery Structure

### 90-Minute Deep Work Sprints

Research shows 40% higher productivity when aligning with natural ultradian rhythms.

**Sprint 1**: ___:___ - ___:___ | Focus:
**Recovery**: 15-20 min | Activity:

**Sprint 2**: ___:___ - ___:___ | Focus:
**Recovery**: 15-20 min | Activity:

**Sprint 3** (optional): ___:___ - ___:___ | Focus:
**Recovery**: 15-20 min | Activity:

> Maximum 2-3 deep work cycles per day. Pushing through fatigue triggers the "Ultradian Stress Response" - increased cortisol, poor cognition, declining motivation.

### Recovery Break Ideas (No Screens)

- Walk outside (even 5 minutes)
- Stretch or movement
- Hydrate and light snack
- Brief meditation or breathing
- Connect with someone you care about
- Look at something beautiful

## Energy Management Principles

### Physical Energy is the Foundation
- Sleep is non-negotiable infrastructure
- Movement generates energy, not just expends it
- Nutrition affects cognitive capacity directly

### Spiritual Energy Provides the "Why"
- Purpose fuels all other dimensions
- Alignment with values sustains effort
- Disconnect from meaning drains faster than overwork

### All Four Must Work Together
Like "an engine sputtering when one of its cylinders misfires" - neglecting any dimension diminishes overall capacity.

## Prompts for Reflection

- Am I matching high-energy periods to high-value work?
- Am I treating recovery as a performance strategy, not weakness?
- When energy is depleted, am I prioritizing recovery over pushing through?
- What's one small thing I can do right now to restore energy?
