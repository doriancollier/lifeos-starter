# A-Priority Filter

**Purpose**: Validate that A-priorities truly deserve that status. Prevent false urgency from consuming leverage capacity.

**Time**: 2-3 minutes per task | **Use**: Before finalizing daily A-priorities

---

## The Four-Question Test

*For each proposed A-priority, answer honestly:*

### Task: _________________________________

| Question | Yes | No |
|----------|-----|----|
| **1. High Impact?** Does completing this create significant value toward my goals? | [ ] | [ ] |
| **2. Time-Sensitive?** Are there real consequences if this waits until tomorrow? | [ ] | [ ] |
| **3. Requires My Judgment?** Does this need my specific knowledge, or could someone else do it 70% as well? | [ ] | [ ] |
| **4. Clear Success Criteria?** Do I know what "done" looks like? | [ ] | [ ] |

---

## Decision Matrix

**4 Yes** = True A-Priority. Protect time, execute with full energy.

**3 Yes** = Review. Which criterion is missing?
- If not High Impact: Downgrade to B
- If not Time-Sensitive: Schedule for appropriate time, may be B today
- If not Requires You: Delegate now
- If not Clear Criteria: Define success before starting

**2 or fewer Yes** = Not A-Priority. Reframe or remove.

---

## Alternative Paths

If the task fails the filter, consider:

- [ ] **Delegate**: Who else could handle this?
- [ ] **Defer**: When is the real deadline? Schedule appropriately.
- [ ] **Batch**: Can this combine with similar tasks?
- [ ] **Eliminate**: What happens if this never gets done?

---

## Quick Validation Checklist

Before committing to A-priorities, verify:

- [ ] Max 5 A-tasks (structural limit)
- [ ] Each passes 4-question test
- [ ] At least one builds leverage (system, content, relationship)
- [ ] Scheduled during peak energy hours
- [ ] Clear completion criteria defined

---

## Red Flags

Watch for these false A-priority patterns:

- "Someone is waiting" (urgency illusion - is it truly urgent for YOUR goals?)
- "It's been on the list forever" (guilt, not importance)
- "I'm the only one who can" (often false - test delegation)
- "It feels important" (pressure vs. actual impact)
- "Quick win" (speed does not equal priority)

## Coaching Questions

*If struggling to decide:*

- "Is this in my vital 20%, or is it useful many in disguise?"
- "What am I NOT doing because I'm doing this?"
- "Am I being productive or just busy?"
- "Would the person I'm becoming prioritize this?"

*"If it's not a clear A, it's a B. Protect your leverage capacity."*
