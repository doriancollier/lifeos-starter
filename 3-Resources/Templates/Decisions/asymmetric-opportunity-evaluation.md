# Asymmetric Opportunity Evaluation: {{title}}

> [!ai-context]
> Evaluate opportunities through the lens of asymmetric returns: structure choices so potential gains significantly exceed potential losses. Based on Nassim Taleb's principles. Use for career moves, investments, partnerships, new commitments, and strategic pivots.

## Opportunity Overview

**Opportunity**:


**Type**:
- [ ] Career / Professional
- [ ] Financial / Investment
- [ ] Partnership / Relationship
- [ ] Project / Commitment
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Investment Required**:
- Time:
- Money:
- Energy:
- Reputation:

## Part 1: Downside Assessment

### Worst Case Scenario

**What is the absolute worst outcome?**


**Probability of worst case**: %

### Recoverability Analysis

**How long to recover from worst case?**
- [ ] < 1 month
- [ ] 1-6 months
- [ ] 6-12 months
- [ ] 1-3 years
- [ ] 3+ years
- [ ] Permanent damage

**What resources would recovery require?**


### Ruin Potential (Critical Check)

> Would failure at this wipe me out in any dimension?

| Dimension | Ruin Risk? | Explanation |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Financial | Yes / No | |
| Reputation | Yes / No | |
| Relationships | Yes / No | |
| Health | Yes / No | |
| Career | Yes / No | |

**If ANY dimension shows ruin risk**: This is an automatic NO unless you can eliminate the ruin pathway.

### Can I Survive the Worst Case?

- [ ] Yes, comfortably
- [ ] Yes, with difficulty
- [ ] Barely
- [ ] No (STOP - do not proceed)

---

## Part 2: Upside Evaluation

### Best Case Scenario

**What is the realistic best outcome?**


**Probability of best case**: %

### Gain Assessment

**What do I stand to gain?**
- Financial:
- Career/Professional:
- Relationships/Network:
- Skills/Knowledge:
- Optionality:
- Joy/Fulfillment:

### Scalability

**Does success at this create compounding returns?**
- [ ] Yes - success opens more doors
- [ ] Somewhat - modest follow-on opportunities
- [ ] No - this is a one-time gain

**What doors does this open?**


---

## Part 3: Asymmetry Ratio

### Calculate the Ratio

**Maximum Downside** (quantify if possible):


**Maximum Upside** (quantify if possible):


**Asymmetry Ratio**: Upside / Downside =

### Ratio Interpretation

| Ratio | Assessment | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| < 1:1 | Negative asymmetry | Decline |
| 1:1 - 3:1 | Break-even to modest | Needs other justification |
| 3:1 - 10:1 | Good asymmetry | Worth serious consideration |
| > 10:1 | Excellent asymmetry | Strong candidate |

**This opportunity's asymmetry**:
- [ ] Negative (decline)
- [ ] Modest (needs strong other reasons)
- [ ] Good (proceed with caution)
- [ ] Excellent (likely proceed)

## Part 4: Optionality Check

### Future Options Created

**What future possibilities does this open?**

1.
2.
3.

### Future Options Foreclosed

**What possibilities does this close off?**

1.
2.
3.

### Exit Ability

**Can I exit early if it's not working?**
- [ ] Yes, easily (two-way door)
- [ ] Yes, with some cost
- [ ] Difficult (mostly one-way door)
- [ ] No exit (one-way door)

**Cost of exit**:


### Optionality Verdict

**Does this create more options than it forecloses?**
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] Roughly equal
- [ ] No

## Part 5: Via Negativa Consideration

> Before adding this opportunity, consider: Is there something to remove instead?

### The Removal Question

**What problem am I trying to solve by adding this?**


**Could I solve that problem by removing something instead?**
- [ ] Yes - consider removal first
- [ ] No - addition is necessary

**If yes, what could I remove?**


### Simplicity Check

**Is there a simpler path to the same outcome?**


---

## Part 6: Additional Filters

### Lindy Test

**Is this based on time-tested principles or a current trend?**
- [ ] Lindy-tested (has worked for decades/centuries)
- [ ] Partially tested (some track record)
- [ ] Trend-dependent (might not survive)

**What's the evidence of durability?**


### One Reason Rule

> "If you need more than one reason to do something, just don't do it." - Nassim Taleb

**Is there ONE overwhelmingly good reason to do this?**

- [ ] Yes: _______________
- [ ] No - I'm rationalizing with multiple reasons

**If multiple reasons**: This might be a sign you're convincing yourself. Reconsider.

### Skin in the Game

**Who is advising me on this, and do they bear consequences of being wrong?**

| Advisor | Their Skin in the Game |
|---------|----------------------|
| | |
| | |

### Emotional/Bias Check

**What's driving my interest?**
- [ ] Genuine opportunity (good)
- [ ] Fear of missing out (bad)
- [ ] Greed (bad)
- [ ] Social pressure (bad)
- [ ] Excitement/novelty (neutral - verify fundamentals)

## Part 7: Barbell Positioning

### Where Does This Fit?

**Is this opportunity**:
- [ ] Safe end (90% allocation, low risk, preserved capital)
- [ ] Speculative end (10% allocation, high risk, unlimited upside)
- [ ] Dangerous middle (moderate risk that feels safe but isn't)

### Current Portfolio Balance

**Before this opportunity**:
- Safe commitments: %
- Speculative commitments: %
- Middle-ground commitments: %

**After this opportunity**:
- Safe commitments: %
- Speculative commitments: %
- Middle-ground commitments: %

**Does this improve or worsen my barbell balance?**

## Part 8: Slack Assessment

### Current Slack Levels

| Resource | Current Buffer | After This Commitment |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| Time | | |
| Money | | |
| Energy | | |

**Am I operating at 100% already?**
- [ ] No, I have slack (good)
- [ ] Close to capacity (caution)
- [ ] Yes, maxed out (do not add)

### Black Swan Readiness

**If something unexpected happens while pursuing this, can I handle it?**


---

## Decision

### Summary Assessment

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Asymmetry Ratio | | |
| Ruin Risk | | |
| Optionality | | |
| Lindy Test | | |
| Barbell Fit | | |
| Slack Impact | | |
| Via Negativa | | |

### Final Decision

- [ ] **Proceed** - Strong asymmetry, no ruin risk, creates options
- [ ] **Proceed with limits** - Cap exposure at: _______________
- [ ] **Delay** - Wait for: _______________
- [ ] **Decline** - Because: _______________

### If Proceeding

**Maximum exposure I'll accept**:
- Time:
- Money:
- Energy:

**Exit triggers**:
1.
2.

**Review date**:

## Reflection Questions

Before finalizing:

- [ ] Can I survive the worst case?
- [ ] Is the upside-to-downside ratio at least 3:1?
- [ ] Am I adding complexity when I could remove harm instead?
- [ ] Is there ONE good reason, or am I convincing myself with many?
- [ ] Do I have slack, or will this max me out?
