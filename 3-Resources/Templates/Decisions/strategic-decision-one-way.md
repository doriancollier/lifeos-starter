# Strategic Decision (One-Way Door): {{title}}

> [!ai-context]
> For irreversible or difficult-to-reverse decisions (Type 1 / One-Way Door). These decisions require slow, deliberate analysis. Use the 70% rule: decide with 70% of desired information, but take the time to get quality information. Consider breaking into smaller two-way door experiments.

## Decision Overview

**Decision Being Considered**:


**Why This Is One-Way**:
- [ ] Financial commitment that can't be recovered
- [ ] Reputation/relationship impact that can't be undone
- [ ] Time investment that can't be reclaimed
- [ ] Opportunity cost - closes other major paths
- [ ] Legal/contractual binding
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Decision Deadline**:

**Current Information Level**: % (target: 70%+)

## Part 1: Strategic Context

### Vision Alignment

**How does this align with my 10-year vision?**


**Which strategic priority does this serve?**


**What's my competitive positioning after this decision?**


### Focus Filter Check

**Does this align with my core focus areas?**
- [ ] Yes - directly supports focus
- [ ] Partially - tangentially related
- [ ] No - outside focus (requires strong justification)

**If no, why am I considering it?**

## Part 2: Second-Order Thinking

### Consequence Mapping

**1st Order** (immediate consequences):


**2nd Order** (chain reactions, 1-3 years):


**3rd Order** (long-term effects, 3-10 years):


### The "And Then What?" Exercise

Run through the decision:
1. I do X, and then...
2. That leads to Y, and then...
3. That leads to Z, and then...
4. That leads to...
5. That leads to...

**What emerges from this chain?**


### Negative Second-Order Effects

**What bad things could follow from good first-order outcomes?**


---

## Part 3: Optionality Analysis

### Options Created

**What future possibilities does this open?**

1.
2.
3.

### Options Foreclosed

**What possibilities does this close forever?**

1.
2.
3.

### Can This Be Broken Down?

> Type 1 decisions should be broken into smaller Type 2 decisions and tested with fast, low-cost experiments.

**Smaller experiments I could run first**:

| Experiment | Cost | Time | What It Tests |
|------------|------|------|---------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Minimum viable commitment** (smallest version that tests the thesis):

## Part 4: SWOT Impact

### Strengths Leveraged

**How does this use my existing advantages?**


### Weaknesses Exposed

**What vulnerabilities does this create or amplify?**


### Opportunities Created

**What new possibilities emerge?**


### Threats Introduced

**What new risks does this bring?**


---

## Part 5: Personal Moat Analysis

### Moat Impact

**Does this deepen my moat?**
- [ ] Yes - builds unique, durable advantage
- [ ] Neutral - neither strengthens nor weakens
- [ ] No - dilutes my position

**Explain**:


### Unique Combination

**Does this create a rare skill/experience combination?**


### Defensibility

**Is this position defensible long-term?**
- [ ] Yes - hard for others to replicate
- [ ] Somewhat - could be copied with effort
- [ ] No - easily replicable

## Part 6: Inversion and Risk

### Pre-Mortem Summary

**If this fails spectacularly, what happened?**

1.
2.
3.

### Ruin Risk Check

**Could this decision lead to ruin in any dimension?**

| Dimension | Ruin Possible? | Mitigation |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Financial | | |
| Career | | |
| Relationships | | |
| Health | | |
| Reputation | | |

### What Would I Tell a Friend?

**If my best friend was making this decision, what would I say?**

### What I Know

| Information | Confidence | Source |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| | H/M/L | |
| | H/M/L | |
| | H/M/L | |

### What I Don't Know

| Unknown | Importance | How to Find Out |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| | H/M/L | |
| | H/M/L | |
| | H/M/L | |

### Information I Need Before Deciding

### What Would Change My Mind?

**Conditions that would make me decide differently**:

## Part 8: Consultation

### Who Should Weigh In?

| Person | Why | Contacted? | Their Input |
|--------|-----|------------|-------------|
| | | Yes/No | |
| | | Yes/No | |
| | | Yes/No | |

### Board of Advisors Perspective

Consider consulting `/board:advise` for major one-way doors.

**Have I convened advisors?**
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No - should I?

---

## Part 9: Decision Framework

### Strategic Patience vs. Urgency

**Am I acting from strategic patience or fear-based avoidance?**

**S.T.O.P. Check**:
- **Signal**: What triggered this decision?
- **Time**: Have I created adequate space to think?
- **Orient**: What's actually happening here?
- **Proceed**: Do I have clarity, or am I reacting?

### Reversibility Exploration

**Is there ANY way to make this more reversible?**

- [ ] Pilot period
- [ ] Smaller initial commitment
- [ ] Exit clauses
- [ ] Staged approach
- [ ] Other: _______________

### The 70% Rule

**Do I have 70% of the information I'd ideally want?**
- [ ] Yes - can decide
- [ ] No - what's missing?

**Time cost of getting more information vs. benefit**:

| Second-Order Impact | |
| Optionality | |
| Moat Impact | |
| Ruin Risk | |
| Information Level | |

### Go/No-Go

- [ ] **Go** - Proceed with full commitment
- [ ] **Go with conditions** - Proceed after:
  -
  -
- [ ] **Go smaller** - Start with this experiment: _______________
- [ ] **Delay** - Until: _______________
- [ ] **No-Go** - Because: _______________

### If Proceeding

**Key commitments**:
1.
2.
3.

**Red flags that would trigger reassessment**:

## Closing Reflection

**Is this confidence or overconfidence?**
