# Provider Decision Filter

*Use this when evaluating career opportunities, major financial decisions, or significant commitments.*

## The Decision

**What opportunity or choice am I evaluating?**


**Why am I considering this?**


---

## Financial Impact

### Wealth vs. Income
- **Does this build wealth, or just generate income?**
  *Building wealth creates lasting security. Income alone can disappear.*


- **Does this create runway or consume it?**
  *Runway = freedom to make choices from abundance, not desperation.*


- **Will this move me toward passive income and freedom?**


### Risk Assessment
- What's the financial downside if this doesn't work out?
- Can my family absorb that risk comfortably?
- What would I need to give up?

---

## Presence Impact

### Time & Energy
- **Will this allow the presence my family needs right now?**
  *Be honest. {{child_name}} is 15—these years don't come back.*


- **Am I trading short-term income for long-term presence?**
  *Sometimes that trade is worth it. Sometimes it's not.*


- **What schedule flexibility does this offer?**


### The Real Question
*If I'm being honest with myself, how will this affect my availability for:*
- {{child_name}} (weekly one-on-one, school events, daily connection)?
- {{partner_name}} (date nights, State of Union, daily presence)?
- Family meals and spontaneous moments?

---

## Values Alignment

### Family Interest Check
- **Does this serve my family's long-term interests, or just mine?**


- **What am I teaching {{child_name}} through this choice?**
  *He's watching. What lesson is this modeling?*


- **Can I sustain this without sacrificing health or relationships?**


### Identity Check
- Is this fear talking (fear of missing out, fear of not being enough)?
- Or is this wisdom about providing (genuine opportunity for growth)?

---

## The Ultimate Tests

### The 10-Year Question
**In 10 years, will I regret prioritizing this over family time?**


### The Deathbed Question
**At the end of my life, will I wish I had taken this opportunity—or wish I had been more present?**


### The Values Question
**Does this align with protecting what matters?**


---

## Decision

**My choice:**


**Why this is the right choice:**


**What I need to be watchful about:**


---

*A note: Neither choice is "right" in the abstract. The right choice is the one aligned with who you're becoming—someone strong, loving, and courageous enough to protect what matters, while enjoying the journey.*
