# Financial Runway Dashboard

*Month: {{date:MMMM YYYY}}*

## Why This Matters

"I have 8 months of runway" is clearer than "I have $24,000 in savings." Runway thinking transforms financial security from abstract goal to concrete freedom—the freedom to make choices, take strategic risks, and be present when it matters.

## The Provider Reflection

*Beyond the numbers...*

**Did I build wealth this month, or just earn income?**


**Did my financial decisions this month serve my family or just my comfort?**


**What would I teach {{child_name}} about money based on my behavior this month?**

## Notes

*Space for anything else on your mind about finances, security, or providing...*


---

*Remember: You're not accumulating wealth to prove something. You're building runway to create freedom—freedom to be present, freedom to take meaningful risks, freedom to protect what matters.*
