# Father-Son Check-In

*Date: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}*

## Before You Begin

The research is clear: teens feel emotionally closer to mothers. That's normal. It also means your presence carries *outsized weight* precisely because it's less expected. This time matters more than you think.

The goal isn't to interrogate or lecture. It's to *listen*—really listen—and let him feel heard.

---

## Setting

**Activity:** *(Side-by-side works best—car ride, breakfast, video game, walk)*


**Where:**


**Duration:** *(Even 15-30 minutes of full presence beats hours of distraction)*

---

## The Conversation

### Opening
*Don't ask "How was school?" or "How are you?" Try:*

- "What's been on your mind lately?"
- "Tell me something good and something hard from this week."
- "What's got your attention right now?"

**What he shared:**


### Listen First
*Your job is to receive, not fix. Ask clarifying questions. Validate emotions before moving to problem-solving.*

- What did I hear him saying?
- What emotion was underneath?
- What did I resist the urge to "fix" or lecture about?

**Notes:**


### Share (Brief)
*Model vulnerability by sharing your own challenges. Keep it brief—this is about him.*

**What I shared:**


### Close
*"Anything you need from me this week?"*

**His answer:**


**My commitment:**

## After the Conversation

### Reflection

**What went well?**


**Did I listen more than I lectured?**
*(Be honest with yourself)*


**What did I learn about where he is right now?**


**Did any of his challenges surface where I could offer support?**
*(Remember: offer, don't impose)*


---

## Executive Function Check

*With ADHD, what looks like "not caring" is often neurodevelopmental reality. His executive function may be 30% behind peers.*

**Any school/task challenges mentioned?**


**Does he need support with something specific?**
*(See father-adhd-support template if needed)*


**Did I avoid judging him by neurotypical standards?**


---

## Connection Quality

**On a scale of 1-10, how connected did this conversation feel?**


**What would make the next one better?**


---

## Carry Forward

**Something to remember about where {{child_name}} is right now:**


**Something to follow up on:**


**Next check-in:** *(Block it on the calendar now)*


---

*Remember: You're not trying to be his friend, fix his problems, or impart wisdom. You're trying to be present—fully, completely present. That's the gift. That's what he'll remember.*
