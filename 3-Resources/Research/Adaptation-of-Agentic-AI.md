# Adaptation of Agentic AI

**Source**: [arXiv:2512.16301](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16301)
**Authors**: 30+ researchers (collaborative community effort)
**Read Date**: 2025-12-23

## Summary

This comprehensive review examines how AI agents adapt across diverse domains and applications. The paper synthesizes research on agentic systems—autonomous agents capable of reasoning, planning, and tool use—with particular focus on their capacity to generalize and adjust to new environments and tasks.

### Key Topics Covered

- **Agent Architecture & Foundations** — Core concepts of agentic AI: perception, decision-making, and action mechanisms enabling autonomous operation
- **Tool Integration & Adaptation** — How agents interact with external tools/APIs, select appropriate tools, and adapt usage patterns to novel scenarios
- **Domain-Specific Applications** — Software engineering, knowledge work, web automation, embodied robotics, scientific discovery
- **Learning & Generalization** — How agents improve through experience via reinforcement learning and knowledge transfer

### Main Contributions

- Structured taxonomy of agent adaptation challenges and solution strategies
- Identifies gaps between current agent capabilities and human-level flexibility (particularly out-of-distribution generalization and long-horizon planning)
- Organizes understanding around evaluation metrics, benchmarks, and systematic categorization of adaptation mechanisms
- Connects cognitive science principles to computational implementations
