## Decision-Making Prompts

### First Principles Analysis

- "What would you do if you were starting completely from scratch today?"
- "What assumptions are you making that might not be true?"
- "Are you optimizing for the outcome or following the process others use?"
- "What's the fundamental outcome you want? What's the simplest path to that?"
- "Am I copying what others do or reasoning from fundamentals?"
- "What problem are you actually trying to solve? Go deeper--what problem does that problem cause?"
- "Which constraints are fundamental (physics, economics) vs. artificial (convention, assumption)?"
- "What would a solution look like if you ignored all existing approaches?"
- "What's preventing the simplest possible solution?"

### Inversion Thinking

- "How could this fail spectacularly? What's the most likely cause?"
- "What would you tell your best friend to avoid in this situation?"
- "If you knew this was guaranteed to fail, what would be the cause?"
- "What are you not seeing? What contradicts your assumptions?"

### Second-Order Thinking

- "How will this decision affect the relationship in 5 years?"
- "What are you giving up by making this choice?" (Opportunity Cost)

- "Is this moving toward your vision or away from it?"

### Pre-Mortem Questions

- "Imagine it is [X months/years] from now. This has failed spectacularly. What went wrong?"
- "What's the most likely reason this fails?"

- "What could we do to cause our own failure?"
- "What are we not talking about?" (Elephants)
- "Is this confidence or overconfidence?"
- "What would change our mind about this plan?"

### Asymmetric Returns

- "What's the absolute worst outcome, and can you survive and recover from it?"
- "Is the upside-to-downside ratio at least 3:1?"
- "Does this create future options or close them off? Can you exit early if it's not working?"
- "Would failure at this wipe you out financially, reputationally, or energetically?"
- "Who are you taking advice from on this, and do they have skin in the game?"
- "Have you considered via negativa--is there something to remove instead of adding this?"
