# Mental Models Library

Quick-reference guide for applying mental models in daily decision-making, planning, and problem-solving.

---

## How to Use This Reference

**When to consult this library:**
- Before major decisions (career, financial, relationship)
- During planning sessions (daily, weekly, quarterly)
- When stuck or facing recurring problems
- When evaluating new opportunities

**Application principle:** Use 3-5 models on any important decision to see it from multiple angles. Single-model thinking creates blindspots.

**The Latticework Approach:** Mental models compound. The more you master, the more connections you see. Start with 5-10 core models and build depth before breadth.

---

## Thinking Frameworks

### First Principles Thinking

- **When to use**: High-stakes decisions, when costs seem prohibitive, when current solutions fail, when breakthrough results are needed
- **Core question**: "Am I copying with tweaks or building from fundamentals?"
- **Process**:
  1. Identify and question assumptions ("Why do I believe this?")
  2. Deconstruct to fundamental truths ("What is undeniably true?")
  3. Rebuild solutions from the ground up ("What's possible from scratch?")
- **Watch out for**: Analysis paralysis from questioning everything. Use analogy for 80% of decisions; reserve first principles for the vital 20%.

**Key questions:**
- "What would you do if starting completely from scratch today?"
- "What assumptions are you making that might not be true?"
- "Which constraints are fundamental (physics, economics) vs. artificial (convention, assumption)?"

---

### Inversion (Via Negativa)

- **When to use**: Before major commitments, project kickoffs, quarterly planning, when evaluating relationships
- **Core question**: "How would this fail spectacularly?"
- **Process**:
  1. Define what success looks like
  2. Ask: "What would guarantee failure?"
  3. List specific behaviors that would destroy the outcome
  4. Systematically avoid those behaviors
- **Watch out for**: Over-application leading to pessimism. Balance with positive vision.

**Key questions:**
- "What would you tell your best friend to avoid in this situation?"
- "If this was guaranteed to fail, what would be the cause?"
- "What behaviors would guarantee you don't hit this goal?"

**The Failure Pre-Mortem:**
1. "It is 6 months from now. This has failed spectacularly."
2. Write the failure narrative: "Here's what happened..."
3. Extract specific failure points
4. Create prevention strategies for each

---

### Systems Thinking

- **When to use**: Recurring problems, complex decisions with multiple stakeholders, when symptoms keep returning despite treatment
- **Core question**: "What feedback loop is driving this pattern?"
- **Process** (Iceberg Model):
  1. Event: What just happened? (visible symptom)
  2. Pattern: How often does this occur? What trends?
  3. Structure: What feedback loops and incentives drive this?
  4. Mental Model: What belief creates this structure?
- **Watch out for**: Paralysis from seeing too many interconnections. Set practical boundaries for action.

**Key questions:**
- "What pattern does this event belong to?"
- "At what leverage level are you intervening - parameters, rules, goals, or beliefs?"
- "What stocks is this building or depleting?"

**Feedback Loop Types:**
- **Reinforcing (R)**: Amplifies change (virtuous or vicious cycles)
- **Balancing (B)**: Stabilizes toward equilibrium

**System Traps to Watch:**
- Seeking the wrong goal (optimizing metrics that don't matter)
- Shifting the burden (quick fixes that create dependency)
- Success to the successful (winners take all, losers fall further behind)

---

### Second-Order Thinking

- **When to use**: Before A-priority commitments, difficult conversations, habit decisions, career choices
- **Core question**: "And then what?"
- **Process** (10-10-10 Rule):
  1. How will I feel about this in 10 minutes?
  2. How will I feel in 10 months?
  3. How will I feel in 10 years?
- **Watch out for**: Overthinking minor decisions. Reserve for choices with lasting impact.

**Key questions:**
- "If you do this consistently, what will your life look like in 10 years?"
- "What's the second-order effect of this choice?"
- "How will this affect the relationship in 5 years?"

---

## Decision Models

### Asymmetric Bets

- **When to use**: Evaluating opportunities, investments, career moves, new projects
- **Core question**: "Is the upside-to-downside ratio at least 3:1?"
- **Process**:
  1. Downside: What's the worst case? Can you survive it?
  2. Upside: What's the best case? Is it scalable?
  3. Ratio: Calculate asymmetry (aim for 3:1 minimum, 10:1 ideal)
  4. Ruin Check: Could failure wipe you out? If yes, automatic no.
- **Watch out for**: Multiple reasons to justify a decision often means it's not obvious enough.

**Key questions:**
- "What's the absolute worst outcome, and can you survive and recover?"
- "Would failure wipe you out financially, reputationally, or energetically?"
- "Does this create future options or close them off?"

**The Barbell Strategy:**
- 90% in safety (survival foundation)
- 10% in speculation (unlimited upside)
- Avoid the "middle" of moderate risk (deceptively dangerous)

---

### Pareto Principle (80/20)

- **When to use**: Daily prioritization, quarterly reviews, evaluating where to invest time
- **Core question**: "Which 20% of activities drive 80% of results?"
- **Process**:
  1. List all activities, clients, projects, or ventures
  2. Estimate % of results each contributes
  3. Identify the vital few (top 20%)
  4. Compare time allocation vs. value generation
  5. Reallocate or eliminate the trivial many
- **Watch out for**: Some important things (family, mentors) are low-frequency but high-importance. Don't confuse time spent with value.

**Key questions:**
- "Is this in your vital 20%, or is it a distraction from what matters?"
- "Which 3 tasks today will create 80% of the value?"
- "What's in your bottom 20% that you could eliminate?"

**Nested Pareto (64/4 Rule):**
Apply 80/20 twice: 4% of inputs drive 64% of results. Find the 20% of your 20% and triple down.

---

### One-Way vs Two-Way Doors

- **When to use**: Distinguishing reversible from irreversible decisions
- **Core question**: "Can I easily reverse this if wrong?"
- **Process**:
  1. One-way door (irreversible): Requires extensive analysis and caution
  2. Two-way door (reversible): Move fast, learn, adjust
- **Watch out for**: Treating two-way doors like one-way doors (analysis paralysis on reversible decisions).

**Key questions:**
- "Can you exit early if this isn't working?"
- "What's the cost of being wrong and needing to reverse?"
- "Is perfectionism appropriate here, or is speed more valuable?"

---

### Circle of Competence

- **When to use**: Before taking on new ventures, making investments, giving advice
- **Core question**: "Is this inside my circle of competence?"
- **Process**:
  1. Define what you truly understand deeply
  2. Recognize the boundaries of your knowledge
  3. Either stay inside or find someone who has this in their circle
- **Watch out for**: Overconfidence about the size of your circle. It's smaller than you think.

**Key questions:**
- "Do I have genuine expertise here, or am I playing amateur?"
- "Who has this in their circle of competence?"
- "Am I confusing familiarity with understanding?"

---

### Opportunity Cost

- **When to use**: Before any significant commitment of time, money, or energy
- **Core question**: "What am I giving up by choosing this?"
- **Process**:
  1. Identify the best alternative use of these resources
  2. Compare value of this choice vs. best alternative
  3. Make explicit trade-off decision
- **Watch out for**: Ignoring opportunity cost leads to overcommitment.

**Key questions:**
- "What existing activity would this replace?"
- "What could you do with this time/money/energy instead?"
- "Is the trade-off worth it?"

---

### Regret Minimization

- **When to use**: Major life decisions, career pivots, relationship choices
- **Core question**: "When I'm 80, which choice will I regret less?"
- **Process**:
  1. Project yourself to age 80
  2. Look back at this decision
  3. Ask which path leads to fewer regrets
- **Watch out for**: Short-term discomfort vs. long-term regret are different. Don't optimize for comfort.

**Key questions:**
- "Will you regret not trying this when you had the chance?"
- "Is this fear of action or fear of regret talking?"
- "What would older-you advise?"

---

## Quick Decision Filters

Use these as rapid screening questions before deeper analysis:

| Filter | Question | Red Flag Response |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Ruin Risk | "Could failure wipe me out?" | Yes = automatic no |
| Via Negativa | "Should I remove something instead of adding this?" | Often yes |
| Asymmetry | "Is upside at least 3x downside?" | No = reconsider |
| Vital Few | "Is this in my top 20%?" | No = likely defer |
| Reversibility | "Can I easily undo this?" | No = slow down |
| Competence | "Do I truly understand this domain?" | No = get help |
| One Reason | "Is this decision obvious without multiple justifications?" | No = reconsider |

## Supporting Concepts

### Margin of Safety

Always build buffers. The question is not "What's the expected outcome?" but "Can I survive if everything goes wrong?"

- Financial: 6-12 months emergency fund
- Time: Don't schedule back-to-back; leave 20% buffer
- Energy: Don't operate at 100%; chronic busyness creates fragility

### Slack and Redundancy

Maintaining extra capacity that seems wasteful during normal times provides survival margin during shocks. "When running at 10 out of 10, there's nowhere left to go when a Black Swan occurs."

### The Lindy Effect

Things that have been around for a long time will likely continue. Prefer time-tested principles over trends. If something survived 1000 years, it will likely survive another 1000.

### Hanlon's Razor

"Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by incompetence or oversight." Before assuming bad intent, consider honest mistakes.

### Compounding

Small, consistent, accumulated progress creates exponential growth. Patience and consistency beat occasional intensity. Daily habits compound; sporadic effort doesn't.

**Key insight:** Most people quit before seeing results because compounding is slow at first and explosive later.

### Skin in the Game

Trust advice from people who bear consequences of being wrong. "Don't tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio."

## Integration with Daily Practice

### Morning Planning
- "Which 3 tasks will drive 80% of today's value?" (Pareto)
- "What could derail today? How will I handle it?" (Inversion)
- "Is there buffer for the unexpected?" (Margin of Safety)

### Before A-Priorities
- "Does this serve a fundamental goal or inherited obligation?" (First Principles)
- "What are the second-order effects?" (Second-Order Thinking)
- "What am I giving up by choosing this?" (Opportunity Cost)

### Weekly Review
- "What were my vital few activities?" (Pareto)
- "What did I successfully avoid?" (Inversion)
- "What can I subtract rather than add?" (Via Negativa)
- "What compounded positively? Negatively?" (Compounding)

### Before New Commitments
- "If starting from a blank slate, would I add this?" (Sunk Cost awareness)
- "Is the upside-to-downside ratio at least 3:1?" (Asymmetric Bets)
- "Does this deepen my existing top 20% or dilute focus?" (Pareto)
- "What would failure look like and can I survive it?" (Ruin Risk)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Common Mental Model Misuses

| Trap | Description | Correction |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Hammer Syndrome | Using one favorite model for everything | Apply 3-5 models to important decisions |
| Analysis Paralysis | Questioning every assumption | Use first principles on vital 20% only |
| Excessive Pessimism | Over-applying inversion | Balance with positive vision |
| False Precision | Pretending to calculate exact probabilities | Use ranges and acknowledge uncertainty |
| Model Worship | Following models blindly | Models are maps, not territory |

### When Models Conflict

Models sometimes give contradictory guidance. When this happens:
1. Note the tension explicitly
2. Consider which model is most relevant to this specific context
3. Weight toward avoiding catastrophic downside (Inversion + Margin of Safety usually win)
4. Trust your judgment after considering multiple perspectives

## Building Your Latticework

### Starter Set (Master These First)
1. **Inversion** - Avoid stupidity before seeking brilliance
2. **Pareto (80/20)** - Focus on the vital few
3. **Second-Order Thinking** - Consider ripple effects
4. **Via Negativa** - Improve by subtraction
5. **Compounding** - Small consistent actions win

### Intermediate Models
6. **First Principles** - Reason from fundamentals

## Quick Reference Card

**Before any major decision, ask:**

1. What would guarantee failure? (Inversion)
2. Is this in my vital 20%? (Pareto)
3. Can I survive the worst case? (Margin of Safety)
4. What am I giving up? (Opportunity Cost)
5. What happens next, and then what? (Second-Order)
6. What could I remove instead of add? (Via Negativa)
7. Is the upside at least 3x the downside? (Asymmetric Bets)
8. Am I reasoning from fundamentals or copying? (First Principles)

**Remember:** Avoiding stupidity is more reliable than seeking brilliance. The goal is not to be smart, but to consistently not be dumb.
