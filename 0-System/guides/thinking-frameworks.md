# Thinking Frameworks Guide

Mental models for better decisions and planning.

## Core Frameworks

### First Principles Thinking
Break problems down to fundamental truths, then reason up.
- Ask: "What would I do if starting from scratch today?"
- Challenge: "What assumptions am I making that might not be true?"

### Inversion (Charlie Munger)
Think backwards from failure to avoid mistakes.
- Ask: "How could this fail spectacularly?"
- Ask: "What would guarantee failure? Am I doing anything on that list?"

### Second-Order Thinking
Consider consequences of consequences.
- Ask: "What happens in the 2nd and 3rd order?"
- Ask: "If I do this consistently, what will life look like in 10 years?"

### Systems Thinking
See interconnections, not just events.
- Map feedback loops (virtuous and vicious)
- Identify leverage points (where small changes create big effects)
- Track stocks and flows (what accumulates, what depletes)

## Decision Frameworks

### One-Way vs Two-Way Doors
- One-way: Irreversible, high stakes → Full analysis
- Two-way: Reversible → Bias toward action, iterate

### Asymmetric Returns (Taleb)
- Look for capped downside, unlimited upside
- Ask: "Is the upside-to-downside ratio at least 3:1?"
- Via negativa: Sometimes removing is better than adding

### Pareto Principle (80/20)
- 20% of efforts create 80% of results
- Ask: "Which 20% of this week's tasks create 80% of value?"
- Ruthlessly eliminate the trivial many

### Eisenhower Matrix
| | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|---|--------|------------|
| Important | Q1: Do first | Q2: Schedule (highest leverage) |
| Not Important | Q3: Delegate/limit | Q4: Eliminate |
