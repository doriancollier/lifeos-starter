# Retrospectives Guide

Learning from experience through structured reflection.

## Retrospective Cadences

| Level | Frequency | Format | Duration |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Daily | End of day | Quick 3 Ls | 5 min |
| Weekly | Sunday | 3 Ls expanded | 15-20 min |
| Monthly | Month end | 4 Ls + Energy Audit | 30-45 min |
| Quarterly | Every 12 weeks | Sailboat | 60-90 min |
| Annual | December | Full Life Review | 2-4 hours |
| Project | Project end | Blameless Postmortem | 30-60 min |

## Formats

### 3 Ls (Daily/Weekly)
- **Liked**: What worked well? What to repeat?
- **Learned**: What insight emerged? What surprised?
- **Lacked**: What was missing? What to do differently?

### 4 Ls (Monthly)
- **Liked**: Successes and wins
- **Learned**: Insights and discoveries
- **Lacked**: Gaps and misses
- **Longed For**: What I wished I had/did

### Sailboat (Quarterly)
- **Wind** (propelling forward): What accelerated progress?
- **Anchor** (holding back): What slowed us down?
- **Rocks** (risks ahead): What dangers do we see?
- **Sun** (destination): Are we still heading the right direction?

### Blameless Postmortem (Projects)
1. What was the goal?
2. What happened?
3. What worked?
4. What didn't work?
5. What would we do differently?
6. What will we carry forward?

## Key Principles

1. **Blameless**: Focus on systems, not individuals
2. **Specific**: Concrete examples, not generalizations
3. **Actionable**: End with specific changes to make
4. **Regular**: Consistency beats intensity

## Ray Dalio's Formula

**Pain + Reflection = Progress**

When something hurts:
1. Don't suppress it
2. Reflect on what it reveals
3. Extract the principle
4. Apply to future decisions
