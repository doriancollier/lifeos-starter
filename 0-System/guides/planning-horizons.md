# Planning Horizons Guide

How to connect daily actions to life mission through nested planning rhythms.

## The Hierarchy

Annual → Quarterly → Monthly → Weekly → Daily

Each level provides context for the level below and receives feedback from the level above.

## Planning Cadences

| Horizon | Frequency | Duration | Primary Question | Output |
|---------|-----------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Annual | January | 2-4 hours | "What do I want this year to be about?" | Annual theme + 3-5 goals |
| Quarterly | Every 12 weeks | 1-2 hours | "What are my Big Rocks for the next 90 days?" | 3-5 quarterly rocks |
| Monthly | Start of month | 30-60 min | "What's my focus this month?" | Monthly theme + milestones |
| Weekly | Sunday | 30-45 min | "What are my Big 3 this week?" | Weekly Big 3 + calendar blocks |
| Daily | Morning | 15-20 min | "What matters most today?" | A/B/C priorities |

## Annual Planning

## Cascade Check

During daily planning, verify alignment:
1. "What quarterly rock does today advance?"
2. "What monthly theme does this serve?"
3. "What are my weekly Big 3?"
4. "Does this align with my annual theme?"
